def bar_returns(close: Any, *, label: str = "") -> Any:
    """Per-bar simple returns, defined only where the prior price is positive.

    ``close.pct_change()`` silently assumes ``price[t-1] > 0``. That holds for
    equities but not for instruments that can print zero or negative prices,
    such as European day-ahead power. As the divisor approaches zero an
    ordinary absolute move reads as an enormous *percentage* move, so a
    compounded aggregate explodes; at exactly zero the next bar is ``inf``,
    which ``fillna`` does not neutralise (it fills ``NaN``) and which collapses
    ``(1 + r).prod()`` to ``nan`` (#872).

    A return is therefore defined only when the previous price is finite and
    strictly positive. Otherwise it is undefined and reported as ``0.0``,
    never ``inf`` or ``nan``. For an all-positive series this is identical to
    ``pct_change().fillna(0.0)``, so ordinary equity/crypto runs are unchanged.

    The prior price is carried forward across gaps. ``pct_change`` did this
    implicitly via ``fill_method='pad'`` — its default on pandas < 3, removed
    in 3.0 — so *not* forwarding it would silently change every gapped series
    (a halt longer than ``_align``'s ``ffill_limit``, a thinly-traded symbol)
    and would make the bit-identity claim above false on the pinned pandas.
    Doing it here explicitly keeps that promise and, unlike the old default,
    gives the same answer on every supported pandas version. Note the effect
    is to attribute the whole across-gap move to the resumed bar; that is what
    a position held through the halt actually earned. Whether that is the right
    convention for *statistics* (it is not, for correlation — see
    ``correlation.py``, which drops the observation instead) is a separate
    question from whether this function may change it as a side effect.
