"""Preemptive kill-switch action: cancel resting orders, then flatten positions.

SPEC.md §7.5 component 6. The filesystem ``HALT`` sentinel (``src.live.halt``)
is the LLM-independent *trigger*; this module is the *action* the runner executes
once a trip is observed. It upgrades the cooperative order-time halt (which only
refuses the next order) to **preemptive**: on trip the runner

1. cancels every resting/open order, then
2. — only if the active mandate permits flattening — submits closing orders for
   every open position.

Cancel-before-flatten ordering is deliberate: a resting order left live while we
flatten could fill against our closing trade and re-open exposure. Cancelling
first quiesces the book, then the position sweep closes what is actually held.

**Per-mandate flatten flag (SPEC §7.5 #6 "optionally, per mandate").** The frozen
:class:`~src.live.mandate.model.Mandate` has no flatten field today (its
``HardCaps`` carry only ceilings). Until the mandate schema grows one, flattening
defaults to **OFF** (cancel-only) — the safe default, since auto-submitting market
exits is itself a trading action the user may not have authorized. Callers can
opt in explicitly via ``allow_flatten=True``; and if a future mandate schema adds
a truthy ``flatten_on_halt`` attribute, it is honored automatically (read
defensively via ``getattr`` so this module needs no edit when the field lands).
TODO(live-runtime): once ``Mandate``/``HardCaps`` gains a first-class
``flatten_on_halt`` flag, drop the ``getattr`` probe and read it directly.

**No-retry (SPEC §8.5).** Trading is not idempotent. A broker call that errors is
recorded and we move on — it is NEVER retried, exactly like ``mcp._call_tool``.
A failed cancel/flatten must surface as an error in the returned report, not be
silently re-sent (which could double-trade).

Every broker call — each cancel, each flatten submit, and each error — is written
to the live-action audit ledger via :func:`src.live.audit.write_live_action`
BEFORE the report is returned, so the preemptive sweep is fully reconstructable.
