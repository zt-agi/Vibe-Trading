"""The figures block, the shape of a number, and how the two are matched.

This is the gate's whole inference surface: it finds the model's ``figures``
declarations, classifies every prose number by SHAPE (date, symbol, list
marker, measurement, bare integer) and matches prose numbers to declarations.
It reads no natural-language word; roles are declared by the model and shape
is language-independent.

Numbers are read as a renderer shows them: invisible characters, Markdown
escapes, character references and look-alike separators are normalized first,
and every offset is mapped back to the original text.
