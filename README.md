## 📰 News

> ⚠️ **Security warning:** The X account `VibeTrading_HKU`, Virtuals project `101845`, and token contract `0x640BDBF77b6447E8b7DB7894cED84BD1c40571f4` are not official Vibe-Trading assets. We have never launched or endorsed any token or memecoin. Do not buy, connect a wallet, or sign anything. [Details](SECURITY.md#official-channels--impersonation).

- **2026-09-27** 🛠️ **Verifiable run cards and safer research**: Run cards now show hashed backtest execution records and verified metric-to-CSV references in JSON, Markdown and Run Detail ([#1612](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1612)). GTJA high/low recency factors use the correct day count and consistent tie handling ([#1604](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1604)); India short covers check the buy-side circuit band ([#1608](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1608)). Token usage remains readable without exempting arbitrary credential strings ([#1606](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1606)), malformed MCP schemas retain their object properties ([#1607](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1607)), and immediate-order goal checks preserve research questions ([#1605](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1605)). Setup documentation now correctly identifies OpenRouter as the shipped default ([#1609](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1609)).

- **2026-09-26** 🛠️ **More reliable indicators and trading limits**: Technical indicators retain their observation date and can reuse results lost during conversation compaction ([#1590](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1590), [#1601](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1601)). All five Qlib158 WVMA windows now use absolute returns in the numerator ([#1594](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1594)); Benford checks preserve the correct leading digit at numeric boundaries ([#1591](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1591)). An explicitly zero exposure limit stays zero ([#1593](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1593)), and Dhan paper orders reject fractional or invalid quantities without rounding away input precision ([#1595](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1595)). Invalid optional numeric environment variables fall back to defaults while explicit configuration constraints remain enforced ([#1592](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1592)). Runtime triggers keep the correct field defaults and subclass factory behavior ([#1599](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1599)).

- **2026-09-25** 🛠️ **More reliable research sessions and channel diagnostics**: A text column in a backtest CSV no longer discards the numeric metrics ([#1579](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1579)), and conversation compaction now counts reasoning content in its retained-message budget ([#1582](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1582)). Failed channel loads now log the actual exception ([#1580](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1580)); the Telegram guide clarifies that CLI and Web controls share the same API runtime ([#1583](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1583)). Robinhood portfolio reads reject malformed buying-power objects while keeping omitted or null values unknown ([#1526](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1526)). Leaving a chat also cancels pending history-scroll timers. Thanks [@Shizoqua](https://github.com/Shizoqua) and [@lorenzozanee](https://github.com/lorenzozanee)!

- **2026-09-24** 💱 **A dollar line priced as pesos, Email and WebSocket in the Web UI, and a CI break from an SDK update**: BYMA and the TSX list US-dollar lines beside their home-currency ones (GGALD.BA, DLR-U.TO), and an Argentine or Canadian backtest priced them in its single peso or Canadian-dollar pool. The loaders now admit a line only in its market's currency, as LSE lines already were, and every other declared quote currency travels with the data, so an answer names the right one ([#1576](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1576)). Hong Kong's RMB and USD counters (80700.HK, 9834.HK), which HKEX numbers in their own code ranges, are refused in a Hong Kong backtest for the same reason and quoted in their own currency. Stock profiles carry the listing's own venue and currency beside the issuer's fundamentals ([#1577](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1577)), grounding and symbol search know every market the data layer routes ([#1575](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1575)), and `technical_indicators` reports volume with the unit its source declares — board lots or shares, 100× apart ([#1571](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1571)). Email and WebSocket join the guided channel setup, with mail-server certificates now verified and settings writes closed to cross-site pages, and a plain IMAP login is upgraded with STARTTLS before the password goes out ([#1544](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1544)). **Fixed:** an explicit provider header lost to an ambient twin under openai 3.19.2, which had turned every PR's CI red ([#1568](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1568)); a backtest from a microsecond-resolution source was dated 1970 ([#1560](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1560)); a research goal that is plainly an order is refused again ([#1562](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1562)); a strict-bench OOS split could leave one side empty ([#1559](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1559)); HRP label alignment, cross-validation label order and non-finite quant inputs ([#1555](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1555), [#1556](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1556), [#1557](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1557), [#1558](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1558)); the shadow-account overtrading window ([#1563](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1563)); and asset growth was read day over day ([#1564](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1564)). Thanks [@Shizoqua](https://github.com/Shizoqua), [@zeus229](https://github.com/zeus229) and [@shadowinlife](https://github.com/shadowinlife)!

- **2026-09-23** 🇦🇷 **Argentine listings, a short book sized upside down, and the last half of the tail-risk gate**: `.BA` symbols — BYMA equities and CEDEARs — route to Yahoo as their own ARS market, and the Web UI groups and labels them like any other; an Argentine backtest still fails closed until BYMA execution rules are modelled ([#1543](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1543)). The mean-variance and turnover-aware optimizers scored every position as if it were held long, so the strongest shorts got the least capital. Both now size on position returns, where a long and a short of two correlated names hedge each other instead of reading as correlated — on a +0.92 correlated pair the old objective put the whole book on the long, the new one splits it 0.51 / -0.49 ([#1548](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1548)). And a tail-risk figure now has to name its own field once a session holds more than one measure or confidence level, so an ES 95% can no longer quote the VaR 95% value under a call id ([#1425](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1425)). **Fixed:** Monte-Carlo validation annualises at the venue's bars per year instead of a hardcoded 252, so its Sharpe agrees with the rest of the same report ([#1546](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1546)); a futures order on a negative-price bar is no longer rejected outright ([#1547](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1547)); a factor's IC ratio is left unset for a negative baseline instead of reading real decay as healthy improvement ([#1549](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1549)); and two memories sharing a title under different types keep their own index rows and link targets ([#1545](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1545)). Thanks [@zeus229](https://github.com/zeus229), [@Shizoqua](https://github.com/Shizoqua) and [@he-yufeng](https://github.com/he-yufeng)!

<summary>Earlier news</summary>

- **2026-09-22** 📅 **Weekly and monthly bars, and a compaction replay that could lose evidence**: `get_market_data` and backtests take `1W` and `1M` (rejected since 09-20 so `1M` would not fetch minute bars). Every source still serves daily bars and the period bar is built from them, dated on the last trading day of its week or month, so a 21-month review is one call of 21 bars ([#1479](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1479)). A price index is stamped unadjusted instead of by what its source does to a stock ([#1541](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1541)). A read-only tool result that context compaction removed is restored from the run's own memory instead of fetched again, capped per run, and a write empties that memory so a regenerated file is read afresh ([#1488](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1488)). A tail-risk figure declared with a field ref is checked against that field, so a VaR 99% quoting the 95% value is caught ([#1444](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1444)). QVeris refuses stock and ETF bars, whose adjustment its search-ranked pick cannot state, and quotes priced per result ([#1494](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1494)). Thanks [@sambazhu](https://github.com/sambazhu), [@zeus229](https://github.com/zeus229), [@he-yufeng](https://github.com/he-yufeng), [@jw232](https://github.com/jw232) and [@cgycorey](https://github.com/cgycorey)!

- **2026-09-22** 💸 **A backtest that died when funding pushed cash below zero, and three more tools that read a rejected query as no data**: a crypto funding debit can leave free cash below zero, and the next position the strategy wanted then found no size that fit, not even zero, so the run aborted with "planned order … exceeds available capital" (or "insufficient capital for position rebalance"). That open is now skipped and reported once as `insufficient_capital`, the bar's reductions still run, and a close whose loss exceeds its margin still aborts the bar as before ([#1542](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1542)). Block trades, margin trading and financial statements now tell Eastmoney rejecting a stale query apart from a genuinely empty answer, through the same check shareholder count, dragon-tiger and lockup expiry use. Answers in Spanish, German and other decimal-comma locales now ground `17,93 %` or `1.410,00 CNY` against the tool results, while two unspaced numbers like `1400,1777` stay two numbers, and a figure has to match its evidence to the precision it is written at ([#1517](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1517)). Thanks [@turtle696966969696](https://github.com/turtle696966969696) for a trace reconciled to the cent, and [@zeus229](https://github.com/zeus229)!

- **2026-09-21** 🔌 **IM channels configured from the Web UI, and 24 alphas that emitted a value computed from a missing bar**: Settings now edits each IM channel with masked secrets, a connection test on the unsaved form, and a per-channel hot apply with no restart; DingTalk and QQ get guided setups ([#1520](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1520), [#1529](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1529)), and every adapter logs through stdlib again, so diagnostics that a `{}` placeholder used to swallow reach the log ([#1533](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1533)). In the Alpha Zoo, a comparison whose operand is NaN because its window holds a missing bar reads False and emits a constant; the #1463 sweep, which nudged the bar by a tick, could not see it. A gap-versus-gap-free check found 24 more alphas, which now mask on their inputs' reach while a correlation undefined on complete data keeps its old verdict ([#1523](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1523), [#1534](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1534), [#1463](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1463)). **Data:** a lockup's `free_shares` is the unlocking quantity, not the float it was read from ([#1513](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1513)); dragon-tiger seats are ranked within each listing reason ([#1512](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1512)); shareholder-count history returns real periods ([#1518](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1518)); Tencent, Eastmoney and AKShare A-share prices are labelled dividend-additive ([#1497](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1497)); Gildata joins the A-share chain as a token-gated source ([#1474](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1474)); portfolios value any ISO-4217 currency and fail one source, not the snapshot, on a missing rate ([#1510](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1510)); `connector account` shows Binance, Futu and Trading 212 balances ([#1539](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1539)). **New:** Bahasa Indonesia UI and README ([#1482](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1482)). **Removed:** the Requesty provider — point `openrouter` at its base URL instead. Thanks [@shadowinlife](https://github.com/shadowinlife), [@he-yufeng](https://github.com/he-yufeng), [@Shizoqua](https://github.com/Shizoqua), [@lorenzozanee](https://github.com/lorenzozanee), [@cgycorey](https://github.com/cgycorey), [@zeus229](https://github.com/zeus229), [@sambazhu](https://github.com/sambazhu), [@Yoruxyv](https://github.com/Yoruxyv) and [@jastincheis](https://github.com/jastincheis)!

- **2026-09-20** 🛠️ **Clearer data requests and everyday fixes**: monthly `1M` requests are now explicitly rejected instead of silently fetching one-minute bars ([#1487](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1487)); weekly/monthly support remains tracked in [#1479](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1479). Welcome quick actions highlight the selected chip ([#1500](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1500)), DingTalk sanitizes downloaded filenames ([#1506](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1506)), Signal preserves text around mentions after emoji ([#1478](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1478)), and credit-spread tables merge equivalent `5` / `5.0` tenor columns ([#1507](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1507)).

- **2026-09-19** 🛠️ **Data errors that looked like missing disclosures or the wrong provider**: A-share shareholder counts work again after an upstream column rename; rejected queries now report the provider's error instead of claiming the stock has no disclosure ([#1490](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1490)). Market-data provenance now names the loader that actually served each symbol, with the matching fallback flag and adjustment label, even when the requested SDK is unavailable ([#1491](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1491)). QVeris no longer overwrites `indicators` with an end date ([#1496](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1496)); adjustment selection, adjusted-response parsing and billing remain tracked in [#1494](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1494). Thanks [@cgycorey](https://github.com/cgycorey) and [@lorenzozanee](https://github.com/lorenzozanee)!

- **2026-09-18** ✂️ **A redacted answer that lost its row numbers, and one starved order counted as twenty-six**: when the grounding gate released an answer with its unverified figures cut, a ranked table came back with `(omitted※)` where 1, 2, 3, the `12m` in its headers and "3 names" in the prose had been. Every integer in a table cell counted as a measurement, and each cut figure's digits were then swept off the rest of the page. A column that numbers its rows is now structure, a plain integer beside words in a cell is read as it would be in a sentence, and the sweep never keys on a single digit; invented returns and multiples are still cut ([#1471](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1471)). In `hold` mode, the search that scales a basket down to the available cash booked a `zero_size` rejection on every step, so one contract the cash could not hold read as 26 lot-rounding failures; it is now one `insufficient_capital` ([#1470](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1470)). **Fixed:** a `local:` code in a backtest is served from your own dataset or refused, never filled from a network source ([#1467](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1467)); the event-study CAR standard error now includes the covariance between daily forecasts that share estimated parameters — with a 30-day estimation window the standardised CAR's variance on null events was 1.41–1.46 and is now 1.07–1.08 ([#1466](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1466)); a real `historical_var` / `parametric_var` result grounds the VaR it returned ([#1464](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1464)); and twenty alphas no longer fill a missing bar with a constant, while recursive smoothers skip the gap and continue under a rule that is now written down and tested ([#1463](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1463)). **Later the same day:** a plain `LANGCHAIN_PROVIDER=openai` setup with `gpt-5.6-terra` failed on its first tool call, because Chat Completions refuses function tools for the `gpt-5.6` models unless the reasoning effort is `none`. The adapter now retries such a request once on `/v1/responses`, where the reasoning is kept, and remembers that route for the model ([#1473](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1473)). **New:** OpenCode Go / Zen as a built-in `opencode` provider that sends the `x-opencode-session` id the relay requires, in the compaction thread too ([#1416](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1416), closes [#1415](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1415)). **Merged:** an entry memory GC archived is no longer handed to compression as well ([#1450](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1450)); the Patell z uses each normal-return model's own degrees of freedom ([#1449](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1449)); the microstructure estimators reject NaN and infinite inputs instead of returning a zero spread ([#1451](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1451)); a source that must never fall back to the network keeps that promise per symbol too ([#1441](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1441)); and a backtest checks the declared interval against the served bar spacing before annualising, so a daily file declared `1H` is no longer annualised at the hourly rate and a weekly file annualises at 52 ([#1432](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1432)). Thanks [@5gaLbt](https://github.com/5gaLbt) and [@turtle696966969696](https://github.com/turtle696966969696) for the reports, and [@tonydo](https://github.com/tonydo), [@Shizoqua](https://github.com/Shizoqua) and [@chiww](https://github.com/chiww) for the fixes!

- **2026-09-17** 🔐 **A Robinhood login that reaches several accounts, and a live gate that refused every real order while its tests passed**: Robinhood can now be a read-only portfolio source that reads exactly one account, picked from Robinhood's own list with nothing preselected ([#1428](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1428)), and live trading binds each mandate to one account the same way ([#1442](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1442)). The runner and the pre-trade gate had been calling Robinhood with no account and reading its replies one level too shallow, so every reconciliation aborted and every order was refused, while the tests stayed green because their fixtures used a reply shape Robinhood never sends. Positions show unpriced until the quote reply is mapped. **Fixed:** a swarm worker saves its message log on every exit path that writes a summary ([#1439](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1439)); qlib158's up- and down-day counts no longer count a missing close as a flat day ([#1459](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1459)); a strategy's decay check no longer reads an infinite Sharpe as healthy ([#1447](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1447)); and a custom alpha-zoo root no longer replaces a bundled alpha of the same name process-wide ([#1468](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1468)). Thanks [@balu1866](https://github.com/balu1866) for the reply shapes, and [@cgycorey](https://github.com/cgycorey) and [@0xouzm](https://github.com/0xouzm)!

- **2026-09-16** 🧪 **Four numerical slips that each returned a plausible number**: "low" sat in the sentiment lexicon as both a bullish and a bearish word, cancelling itself out ([#1448](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1448)); head-and-shoulders detection divided by a signed shoulder average, so lopsided shoulders on a negative-valued series passed the symmetry check ([#1456](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1456)); the options engine annualised over one bar fewer than the shared metrics, exaggerating short runs ([#1458](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1458)); and copula pseudo-observations ranked a missing value as the largest and gave ties arbitrary distinct ranks ([#1453](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1453)). Thanks @Shizoqua.

- **2026-09-15** 🧮 **A grounding gate that decided what a number was from the words around it**: the check every market answer passes before release used to infer whether a figure was a price, a target or a metric from a catalogue of phrasings — 65 regular expressions that grew a fix commit per wording and could give a sentence and its translation different verdicts. The model now declares what each figure is in a `figures` block the reader never sees (`observed`, `derived`, `proposed`, `cited`, `count`); the gate reads only a number's shape and checks every declaration against the session's tool results. A rejected answer gets one correction that names each failing figure with the nearest observed prints, and if it still fails it is released with only those figures cut (`（略※）` / `(omitted※)`) instead of being replaced wholesale by a canned refusal, which remains only for an identity problem or a run that observed no price. While it waits, the chat shows "Checking the figures in this answer" in all eight languages. Before release it went through three rounds of adversarial review and real model runs, which added decimal commas, year-shaped prices, untagged code fences, integer prices of instruments quoted in the thousands, prices declared as counts and unchecked numbers reaching the stream. Metadata counts and metric-name tokens no longer ground a metric, and a sentence with several metrics is no longer rejected ([#1418](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1418), [#1420](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1420), [#1421](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1421), [#1426](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1426), [#1433](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1433)).

- **2026-09-14** 🇰🇷 **A-shares backtested as perpetual futures, and a swarm argument the model could set but never change**: every branchless data source that serves A-shares — `local`, `tencent`, `eastmoney`, `baostock`, `mootdx`, `sina` — routed a pure A-share basket to the crypto engine, which applies none of the A-share rules (stamp tax, T+1, price limits, 100-share lots) and does charge an 8-hourly perpetual funding fee against the position. The run succeeded and its metrics were internally consistent, which is what made it dangerous; a pure A-share basket now reaches `ChinaAEngine` from every source ([#1431](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1431)). Separately, the swarm worker overwrote every tool call's `run_dir` with the agent workspace, so for the tools that declare it — `backtest` above all — the model could pass any directory and read none of it, while the error named no path. A declared `run_dir` is now honoured inside the workspace and refused outside it with the boundary named, and the backtest tool says which directory it checked ([#1430](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1430), [#1429](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1429)). **New:** four connectors land together and the count reaches 18 — **KIS** (한국투자증권; a genuine 모의투자 paper sandbox on its own host, plus read-only live), **Upbit** (KRW crypto; paper + read-only live, capped because the exchange exposes no paper/live discriminator), **Toss Securities** (read-only live; the closed-order history is paged to completion and refused rather than truncated past the cap; read paths validated against a real account) and **Scalable Capital**'s Agentic MCP as a fully read-only profile with an explicit tool allowlist and no order capability ([#1407](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1407), [#1408](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1408), [#1409](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1409), [#1417](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1417)). **Fixed:** the shared SDK diagnostics told every broker's user to check Longbridge; they now name the affected broker's SDK or gateway in all eight languages ([#1436](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1436)). Thanks [@chiww](https://github.com/chiww), [@cgycorey](https://github.com/cgycorey), [@as950118](https://github.com/as950118), [@dudco](https://github.com/dudco) and [@tingkk](https://github.com/tingkk)!

- **2026-09-13** 🗂️ **A broker reply in the wrong shape that counted as an empty account, and run-card diagnostics that never reached the card**: the portfolio layer read positions with an empty list as the default, so a reply that never carried a positions list — an MCP response with no mapping yet, or IBKR's official MCP answering without structured positions — became a source holding nothing, and the snapshot was stored as complete. That is exactly the quietly smaller portfolio the aggregation exists to rule out, so a read without a positions list is now refused: the source shows as an error and the snapshot is marked incomplete, while a genuinely empty account (`"positions": []`) still reads as empty. It surfaced while reviewing a new MCP connector whose holdings are not mapped yet. Separately, the run card kept only scalar metrics, so every dict- or list-shaped diagnostic the engine writes for card readers was dropped — a reader could see how many plans were rejected, but not for which symbol or why. Those metrics now travel in a `structured_metrics` block, capped at 4 KiB of UTF-8 JSON per metric with anything larger named under `_omitted`, and render in the Run Card tab in all eight languages ([#1424](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1424)). Thanks [@cgycorey](https://github.com/cgycorey)!

- **2026-09-12** 📥 **A dividend row that looks like a holding, and a number format where one misplaced separator is a thousandfold error**: extraETF's CSV exports can now be read into the portfolio layer's position shape — read-only, standard library only, and failing closed on anything it cannot read without guessing ([#1406](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1406), toward [#1170](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1170)). The Investments export becomes positions and the Transaktionen export becomes typed movements, so a `Dividende` row, which carries a quantity and a price of its own, is never read as a position, and a transactions file cannot pose as an empty portfolio. Numbers follow the export's German grammar exactly: `1.386,608` is 1386.608, a US-ordered `1,234.56` is refused rather than read a thousandfold off, and a value the eight-decimal wire format cannot hold is refused rather than rounded — `0,000000004` shares would otherwise have become zero. An unknown header (the error names both known column sets), an unknown transaction label, a movement with no instrument, and one instrument listed twice under a single portfolio ID are all refused, while the same ISIN under two portfolio IDs — the export's normal multi-portfolio case — stays two positions. The export carries no snapshot date, so the file's modification time is reported as `source_mtime` and no position claims an observation time. Nothing calls the reader yet; wiring it into the portfolio container is next. Thanks [@cgycorey](https://github.com/cgycorey) and [@KaiLuettmann](https://github.com/KaiLuettmann)!

- **2026-09-11** 📉 **Eight years of Tencent history that came back as the last two, and an evidence gate that turned away every backtest the agent ran itself**: Tencent's `fqkline` endpoint serves the **last** 500 bars of a window, not the first — a CSI 300 request for `2018-01-01..2026-06-30` returns `2024-06-06..2026-06-30` — while the loader paginated forward, stepped past the window after one page and returned a tail-only series with exit code 0 and no warning. It now walks backward from the end date, re-requests an empty page once before believing it, treats an error-shaped reply as a failure, and bumps the loader cache version so series cached by the old walk are never served again ([#1411](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1411), closes [#1410](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1410)). `refresh_strategy_evidence` rejected every run produced by the `backtest` tool, because only the agent runtime wrote the `state.json` its ingestion gate reads; the tool now records success, failure and timeout itself, and the gate stays fail-closed for runs nobody vouches for ([#1413](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1413), closes [#1412](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1412)). Concurrent cold-start data requests could come back `_unresolved` for symbols that were perfectly available: the loader registry marked itself initialised before its imports ran, so simultaneous first callers saw it empty — seven of eight in the reporter's run ([#1405](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1405), closes [#1403](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1403)). A swarm worker's `skills:` list, documented as its allowlist, is now enforced by `load_skill` instead of only by the prompt ([#1414](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1414)), and the correlation skill's Engle-Granger example, which crashed on an unnamed series, now calls the tested quantlib functions instead of its own OLS fit ([#1404](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1404)). One more was ours: thirteen broker config files that hold API keys — `alpaca.json`, `zerodha.json` and the rest — were missing from `.gitignore` though its comment claimed them, so anyone whose `VIBE_TRADING_HOME` is the checkout was one `git add -A` away from committing credentials; a test now derives the list from the code. So was a paper cancel that answered for orders it never placed: the Zerodha, Dhan and Shoonya paper connectors simulate orders locally but read the real account, and acknowledged a cancel for any order id — a live one included, which would have kept working; they now accept only the ids their simulator issued. Thanks [@shadowinlife](https://github.com/shadowinlife), [@alanwilhelm](https://github.com/alanwilhelm) and [@Shizoqua](https://github.com/Shizoqua)!

- **2026-09-10** 🧾 **A remediation message that named a variable nothing reads, and an adapted strategy that wore its parent's sign-off**: when stooq answers with its anti-bot challenge page, the loader tells the operator how to route around it — and both halves of that advice were unreachable as printed. `VIBE_TRADING_MARKET_DATA_ORDER_*` is read nowhere: the registry builds `MARKET_DATA_ORDER_<MARKET>` and the config layer passes it to a bare `os.getenv`, so exporting the name as printed was a silent no-op and stooq stayed at position 2 of the US-equity chain. The other half, "drop stooq from it", is rejected outright — an override must be a **permutation** of the default chain, so a source can be reordered but not removed. The message now names the variable the registry actually reads and states the constraint, pinned to the registry rather than to a literal so it cannot drift again ([#1402](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1402)). Separately, the first half of description-driven strategy adaptation landed: an adapted strategy is a **new** artifact pointing at its parent through `derived_from`, the description may change universe, name and position sizing while the signal is copied verbatim, and the child starts with empty evidence so its numbers come from its own backtest instead of inheriting the parent's ([#1391](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1391), refs [#1149](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1149)). Two gaps were closed on the way in, both one field over from the rule that PR was written to enforce. `dataclasses.replace` copies every field the call does not name, so the child came out `UNVALIDATED` while still carrying the parent's `validator` and `approver` — an independent sign-off worn by something that never earned it — along with an `artifact_version` and a `model_version` for code no model had generated yet. And the parent-evidence gate was reachable only from tests: `register_adaptation` never consulted it, so a stale or insufficient parent was written anyway, against what the substrate advertised. Its inputs are keyword-only and required now, so the check cannot be skipped by forgetting it. Thanks [@chiww](https://github.com/chiww) and [@modelpath-dev](https://github.com/modelpath-dev)!

- **2026-09-09** 🚀 **v0.1.15 released** ([Release notes](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/releases/tag/v0.1.15), `pip install -U vibe-trading-ai`): 551 commits and 162 merged pull requests since 0.1.14, from 35 contributors. **The theme of this cycle is data that says what it is** — and three of the biggest fixes turned out to be the same bug wearing different clothes: a default that quietly substitutes a plausible value for a missing one, which is indistinguishable downstream from a real observation. The Alpha Zoo's NaN contract moved out of the individual alphas and into the registry: an alpha that branches on an `np.where` comparison never sees a NaN — the comparison is `False` — so blanking every declared input on one bar left **84 of 462 alphas returning a number anyway**, each consumed as a real signal because `dropna()` is what keeps a gap out of an IC. The registry now masks output wherever a declared dependency is missing on that bar, and the same sweep afterwards finds none ([#1377](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1377), closes [#1376](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1376)). The warmup half stays open and stated rather than quietly carried: **52 alphas still emit a value inside their own declared `min_warmup_bars`**, and a registry-level warmup mask would also blank rows for alphas that merely over-declare, so that half needs a direction call rather than 52 PRs. Same class, second instance: pandas still defaults `pct_change()` to forward-filling, so a missing close becomes a **0.0% return that never happened**; four PRs fixed one call site each, and an exhaustive sweep found **24 sites across 10 files** — two of them inside the very files those PRs were editing. Third instance: the `futures` loader chain named `tushare` and `akshare`, and **neither implemented a futures endpoint at all**, so every contract fell through to the A-share equity endpoint. AKShare now serves Chinese contracts off the keyless Sina daily endpoints — dated and main-continuous, verified live across SHFE, CFFEX, GFEX and ZCE — while a global contract returns empty and reaches `local` instead of being priced as an equity ([#1395](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1395)). Prices themselves now carry the adjustment caliber they were served under, and a source whose caliber was never measured against a live payload reports `unknown` rather than guessing one ([#1317](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1317)). **Live trading fails closed** in five more places: a broker position read returning an API error, error envelopes arriving mid halt-sweep, the flatten latch across runner restarts, unresolved Alpaca submissions recovered by exact client ID across a restart, and buy-limit orders sized at the worse of quote and limit on both transports. **In the backtest**: options signals fill on the next bar rather than the date they were computed from, short option legs hold margin and gate opens on buying power, perpetual funding settles by bar span on 8h+ intervals, an over-committed rebalance basket scales instead of aborting, and a halted position marks at the last traded close instead of entry cost. **In the agent loop**: a session that had already fetched fundamentals, fund flow, margin and research data had those results cleared to free context, and the de-duplication ledger went on refusing to re-fetch them — **44 blocked retries in one run**, ending in "fundamental data not retrieved" for data the model had already received; results reconcile by exact call identity now, and the no-progress budget counts observations rather than activity. The final batch to land before the tag is those same three themes in miniature. `CL2412.NYMEX` matched no symbol pattern — the bare dated form (`CL2412`) matched and the venue form (`ES.CME`) matched, but the way a contract is actually written matched neither — so a US crude contract ran under T+1, with no shorting, settled in CNY; Tushare's own exchange spellings had the mirror-image problem on the China side, and both halves classify now ([#1396](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1396), closes [#1394](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1394)). The `pct_change()` call sites were being fixed one at a time ([#1397](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1397), [#1398](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1398)) before the exhaustive sweep found the rest, and the same default sat behind TopN selection ranking assets that had no factor observations ([#1399](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1399)) and sentiment orthogonalization regressing on zeros it had filled in itself ([#1400](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1400)). China-futures runs now state which products were priced on a generic default instead of a table entry — `rb`'s real margin rate is 0.10, the same number as the default, and "looked up" must not read like "assumed" (closes [#1393](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1393)). And the ML walk-forward example purges future labels ([#1392](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1392)). **New this cycle:** UK equities (LSE `.L`/`.IL`, with SDRT modelled as a purchase-side-only duty, because charging both sides overstated every round trip by half), **Zerodha Kite Connect** as the fourteenth broker (capped at paper plus read-only, since Kite exposes no runtime live discriminator), a **read-only multi-broker portfolio** across Web, REST, CLI and agent tool where a source that fails to refresh is an error excluded from the totals rather than a stale cache, **fifteen Quant Library additions** (Heston, Hierarchical Risk Parity, copulas, VPIN/Roll/Amihud/Kyle microstructure, barrier options with finite-difference Greeks, ISDA CDS, Key Rate Duration, Vasicek, factor IC, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Ulcer/Pain, event-study tests, group-purged CV), **Brazilian Portuguese** as the eighth locale, read-only **Nobitex and Wallex**, calendar-triggered partial rebalancing, swarm replay and retry, and an **offline evals harness** that emits `NOT_EVALUABLE` rather than passing when the instrumentation it needs is absent. Thanks to all 35 contributors of this cycle!
- **2026-09-08** 🧪 **An alpha that printed a number for a bar whose inputs were blank, and a spot-gold search that answered with a Swedish Bitcoin ETP**: the Alpha Zoo contract preserves NaN through warmup and missing data, but an alpha that branches on an `np.where` comparison never sees a NaN — the comparison is `False`, so the ternary falls through to its constant. Blanking every declared input on one bar of a 462-alpha sweep, **84 alphas returned a number anyway**, and since `dropna()` is what keeps a gap out of an IC, each of those constants was consumed as a real signal. The guard now sits in the registry rather than in each alpha — the output is masked to NaN wherever a declared dependency is missing on that bar — and the same sweep afterwards finds **none** ([#1377](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1377), closes [#1376](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1376)). Eleven alphas were fixed for the other half of the contract, the warmup window ([#1379](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1379), [#1380](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1380), [#1381](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1381), [#1382](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1382), [#1383](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1383)) — and measuring that half the same way leaves **52 alphas still emitting a value inside their own declared `min_warmup_bars`**. A registry-level warmup mask would also blank rows for alphas whose declaration is merely conservative, so that half stays open and stated rather than quietly carried. Separately, `search_symbol("XAUUSD")` returned exactly one candidate — `VALOUR-BTC-0-SEK.ST`, a Swedish Bitcoin ETP — which then locked the run's instrument identity; a metal or FX pair query is an exact instrument assertion now, keeping only candidates that name the same two legs in any spelling ([#1282](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1282)). **Fixed:** an announcement date carries no time of day, so on an intraday frame a filing became visible from the first bar of its own announcement day — a full session of lookahead. Sub-daily frames are refused now, with `fundamental_subdaily="next_day"` as the explicit opt-in (closes [#1387](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1387)). A metric claim formatted as a generic `| Metric | Value |` table escaped the analysis gate that rejects the same claim in prose ([#1375](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1375)), while the mirror-image error rejected a price word used as a formula variable — `close/SMA50 > 1` was read as an asserted price ([#1378](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1378), closes [#1354](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1354)). A pasted broker code (`HK.00700`, `US.AAPL`, `SH.600519`) scanned as no symbol at all, so every market tool answered `identity_required` ([#1384](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1384)). The three Archimedean copula CDFs returned wrong extreme values under strong dependence — Clayton `0.0`, Gumbel `1.0`, Frank `inf` — and are computed in log space now, verified against a 2500-digit reference across θ ∈ [-5000, 5000] ([#1386](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1386), closes [#1385](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1385)). An MT5 order above the symbol's volume cap was silently clamped and sent, an eToro limit order with no limit price rested untriggered while reading as accepted, futu K-lines inherited an undeclared adjustment caliber, and `BTCUSDT` was routed through A-share rules — T+1 and no shorting, on a perpetual ([#1388](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1388)).

- **2026-09-07** 🪙 **A 50-ounce gold order rounded down to nothing, and a currency future priced at 1/2500th of its contract size**: in a cross-market backtest the composite engine dispatches every symbol through one shared sub-engine per market, but only `apply_slippage` refreshed that sub-engine's own active symbol — so `round_size` and `calc_commission` used whichever symbol had synced it last. A 50 oz gold position sized against FX's 1,000-unit micro lot rounded to **0**, gold futures were charged the index future's rate-based fee (6.90) instead of their own flat one (20.00), and swap used the 100,000-unit standard lot rather than the 100 oz metal lot ([#1370](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1370)). Separately, `_extract_product` could not read a symbol whose product code contains a digit or ends in a letter that doubles as a month code: `6EZ4`, `6JH25`, `M2K`, `MYM2503` and `FESX2503` all fell through to the default multiplier of 50 — for `6E` the true figure is 125,000 ([#1369](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1369)). Symbols now resolve against the multiplier table itself, longest match first, which also covers the dated forms (`M2KZ4`) and prefix collisions (`SILZ4` vs `SI`). **Fixed:** four Alpha Zoo factors printed a hard ±1 or 0 through a trading halt and inside their own declared warmup, because a NaN comparison is `False` rather than NaN and the ternary fell through to its constant. `min_warmup_bars` is metadata that nothing trims, and what keeps a gap out of an IC is `dropna()` — so those constants were consumed as real signals ([#1371](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1371), [#1372](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1372), [#1373](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1373), [#1374](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1374)). Measuring the whole zoo the same way puts **82 more alphas in the same shape**; rather than one PR per alpha, that is now tracked as a registry-level guard in [#1376](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1376). Strategy-discovery evidence also resolved position size once for the whole run instead of per regime, and a single unparseable benchmark cell could erase every evidence row that run produced ([#1368](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1368)). **New:** a run that keeps issuing tool calls without gaining information now stops after eight iterations with a visible recovery request, instead of spending its whole budget on path discovery — the reported case burned ~35 iterations re-guessing the same rejected paths. An identical call is refused from its **second** failure rather than its first, so one honest retry after a rate limit or a timeout still runs ([#1363](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1363), closes [#1353](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1353)).

- **2026-09-06** 🛡️ **A buy limit sized at a price it would never fill at, and an audit that returned PASS having verified nothing**: the MCP order gate priced a quantity order from the live quote alone, so a limit at twice the market cleared a cap sized for the quote and could fill at twice the authorized notional. It is sized at the worse of quote and limit now — the rule the direct-SDK path already used — and an unparseable limit price is denied rather than waved through ([#1361](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1361)). The report auditor skipped every point with no fetched value and then reported **PASS** because nothing had failed, certifying a report backed by no evidence at all; that fails closed now ([#1362](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1362)). **Fixed:** metrics survived a failed analysis tool, and the new exemption for attributed figures — right for a paper's Sharpe, wrong for a price this run is meant to observe — would have passed `Analysts say TSLA.US last traded at 412.35 USD.` with no tool call behind it ([#1338](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1338), closes [#1336](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1336)); a cash-dividend row killed the whole trade-journal parse ([#1356](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1356)); compaction re-opened the de-duplication ledger by tool name, so clearing one argument variant left the rest gated ([#1358](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1358)); the compliance ledger refused its first append on Windows ([#1261](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1261)). **New:** Zerodha Kite Connect makes 14 brokers — read and paper only, since Kite exposes no runtime paper/live discriminator ([#1193](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1193)); Nobitex and Wallex add Iranian Toman pairs for 27 data sources, neither able to silently degrade into a USD-quoted venue ([#1263](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1263)); native Anthropic calls cache the static tools-and-system prefix instead of resending it at full price every turn ([#1366](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1366)).

- **2026-09-05** 🔓 **A price the model invented passed the check in English but was caught in Chinese, and an agent that could not re-read data it had already fetched**: the grounding gate matched `close` but not **`closed`**, so `The stock closed at 412.35.` with no tool call behind it went straight through, while the identical fabricated claim in Chinese (`该股收盘 412.35。`) was rejected. `last traded at` and `quoted at` had no rule at all, and Chinese had the mirror-image hole — `成交价` / `最新价` / `股价` / `收报` all missed. Both vocabularies are complete now, the English forms require a following "at" so volume and deal phrasings stay out, and a new suite asserts the two languages reach the **same** verdict per case instead of checking each in isolation. Separately, a session that had successfully fetched fundamentals, fund flow, margin and research data then had those results cleared to free context — and the de-duplication ledger went on refusing to re-fetch them, 44 blocked retries in one run, ending in "fundamental data not retrieved" for data the model had already received. Clearing a result now re-opens that tool, the ledger keys on arguments rather than the tool name, and the token budget counts tool-call arguments instead of scoring a 100 KB payload as ten tokens ([#1349](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1349), [#1341](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1341), [#1352](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1352), closes [#1343](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1343)). **Fixed:** every backtest launched from the Web UI segfaulted on aarch64 — sandbox rlimits ran Python in the forked child of a multi-threaded server, undefined behaviour per POSIX; they are applied after exec now (closes [#1355](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1355)). `GC=F` and `XAUUSD` were classified as China A-shares ([#1280](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1280)); `BRK.B.US` and other dotted class shares fetched an empty chart ([#1351](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1351)); a fully invested rebalance basket aborted on a commission overdraft instead of scaling to fit ([#1344](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1344), closes [#1274](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1274)); percentage-point deltas — `3.6pp`, `3.6 个百分点`, `250 基点` — were read as quoted prices ([#1346](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1346)); joined crypto pairs like `BTCUSDT` went unrecognised while spot platinum resolved to a crypto pair that does not exist ([#1265](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1265)); strategy-store history came back oldest-first when timestamps tied ([#1347](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1347)); the Codex adapter discarded the model the provider reports ([#1348](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1348)). **New:** market context stated earlier in a conversation can narrow symbol resolution, behind `VIBE_CONTEXTUAL_IDENTITY_CONSTRAINTS` ([#1269](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1269)); the investment-committee workers get the fundamental data panel their prompts already assumed ([#1345](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1345)); deterministic USD-M tolerance calibration from recorded comparisons ([#1248](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1248)).

- **2026-09-04** 🩺 **Every Claude 5 run failed on the first request, and a halted position was marked back to what you paid for it**: `langchain-anthropic` moves `temperature` into `extra_body` for the current Anthropic SDK, and our self-heal only popped the top-level key — so the retry re-sent exactly the field the API had just rejected, and every run on `claude-sonnet-5` / `claude-opus-5` died at the first call ([#1330](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1330), closes [#1329](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1329)). In backtests, a position held past the forward-fill limit was re-marked at its entry price: equity printed a drawdown with no market event behind it, and rebalance sizing ran against that phantom mark. A halt of any length now marks at the last traded close, while order fills still refuse a stale price ([#1332](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1332), closes [#1318](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1318)). **Fixed:** three ways a commit-time adjustment could widen the mandate you approved — a stringified number skipped the numeric check, `True` passed as a number, and an instrument whitelist had no comparison at all; cash-only stays the floor of the leverage axis rather than an invalid type, so the safest mandate is still committable ([#1285](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1285)). The elapsed clock survives switching pages, reloading, and reopening a session from history ([#1340](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1340), closes [#1339](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1339)), and the seven open npm advisories in the frontend and desktop lock files are patched.

- **2026-09-03** 📡 **A data source that never answers, and dated figures that could not be proved**: stooq serves non-browser clients a JavaScript proof-of-work page — HTTP 200 with an HTML body — which the loader read as "no data", so position 2 of the US-equity chain was dead weight on every fetch with nothing in the run log to show for it. It is now recognised as unavailable, with a one-time warning naming how to reorder or drop the source ([#1342](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1342), closes [#1315](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1315)). Separately, a generic tool result carrying both a price and its date lost the date on the way into the grounding ledger, so a dated claim had no evidence that could match it and a correct answer was refused; timestamps are carried now, and a row's own date overrides one inherited from the payload ([#1333](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1333)). **Fixed:** the MCP wrappers for goal evidence and status demanded a goal id that the registered tools document as optional, so a client meaning "the current goal" got a validation error ([#1331](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1331)); the Codex adapter discarded the token counts the provider reports, leaving usage accounting on a character-count estimate ([#1334](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1334)). **New:** the swarm's MCP stdio path gets real subprocess coverage in place of a note saying it was untested ([#1335](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1335)).

- **2026-09-02** 💵 **The last two loaders that booked dividends as losses, and an explicit source that answered as someone else**: FMP and Tiingo still served raw OHLC while the rest of the chain served adjusted prices — the same ex-dividend gap read as a real drop, closed for Yahoo on 08-31 and now closed for both ([#1320](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1320), closes [#1296](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1296)). Their rows in the price-caliber table were corrected in the same change: a frame that is adjusted must not be stamped `raw`, or the mixed-caliber warning added in [#1317](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1317) is checking a label instead of the data. FMP also moved to the Stable endpoint, and an explicit `source="fmp"` now fails loudly instead of returning another source's numbers under FMP's name ([#1276](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1276), closes [#1270](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1270)). **Fixed:** a ticker inside full-width parentheses — `公司名（代码）价格` — was split from its own figure, so the unsourced-symbol gate never saw the two together ([#1326](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1326), closes [#1260](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1260)); every `references/` link in the bundled skills now resolves both for the agent and for a human who clicks it on GitHub ([#1328](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1328)). **New:** Brazilian Portuguese joins the interface as the eighth language ([#1327](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1327)).

- **2026-09-01** 🎯 **Options backtests filled at the price the signal was computed from, and a naked short could sell premium it could never cover**: a signal dated T priced off T's own close and IV — phantom edge in every options backtest, not just adversarial ones. Signals now fill on the next bar, and short legs post CBOE-style margin checked against buying power ([#1299](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1299), [#1306](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1306)). **Fixed:** perpetual funding settled once a day against the engine's own 3x/day model ([#1307](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1307)); a 1x short was exempt from liquidation entirely ([#1298](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1298)); composite runs dropped India T+1 and failed open on every price-limit band ([#1309](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1309)). **New:** every served frame states its price caliber — adjusted, raw, or honestly unknown — and a mixed-caliber run says so ([#1317](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1317), closes [#1301](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1301)).

- **2026-08-31** 🧮 **Yahoo booked every dividend as a loss, and the rebalance count you were shown had nothing to do with the fills**: both Yahoo paths served dividend-unadjusted OHLC while the rest of the chain served adjusted prices, so every ex-dividend gap read as a real drop in any US-equity backtest Yahoo won. OHLC now scales to Yahoo's `adjclose` and the yfinance path requests the adjusted series; volume stays raw on both ([#1287](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1287)). Measuring the chain to verify that turned up something worth stating plainly: **sina and longbridge still serve fully unadjusted prices**, so which source you land on still changes the price caliber — that gap is now tracked in [#1301](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1301). Separately, `rebalance_count` counted target-weight *changes*, not executions: a constant-target SPY/BND strategy reported one rebalance against 1,269 trades. Requested and executed are now separate metrics, the executed ones derived from immutable fill records ([#1281](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1281), closes [#1275](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1275)). **New:** `rebalance_mask` runs partial rebalancing on a calendar or on explicit dates instead of every bar ([#1277](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1277), closes [#1273](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1273)); the HTML alpha-bench report now carries the survivorship-bias disclosure the JSON already had, naming the constituent source and its as-of date ([#1289](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1289)). **Fixed:** one unresolved symbol no longer strands the rest of its batch — the chain retries only the missing ones and provenance names the source each symbol actually came from ([#1288](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1288)); a halt sweep could latch an episode it never swept, and two concurrent completions could lose each other's record ([#1254](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1254)); a working Futu OpenD connection rendered as unavailable because its health report omitted `connection_state`; the desktop updater read a permission-denied process probe as "backend exited" ([#1284](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1284)); and a session backgrounded mid-turn kept its sidebar spinner for the life of the tab ([#1257](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1257), closes [#1256](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1256)).

- **2026-08-30** 🇬🇧 **LSE equities arrive without turning pence into pounds, and closed markets stop firing live triggers**: `.L` symbols now work end to end through Yahoo → yfinance → local market-data fallback, stock profiles and financial statements, trade-journal and Shadow consumers, and GBP-settled backtests. The loader treats `.L` only as a venue marker: declared GBp/p prices are divided by 100, GBP passes unchanged, and USD, other, or unknown currencies are rejected before the statically GBP accounting layer. Per-symbol conversion provenance survives cache round trips, and the cache version was bumped so older unsafe entries cannot return; UK execution also uses whole shares and `slippage_uk` ([#1206](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1206), closes [#1205](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1205)). **Fixed:** market-triggered live ticks stop before broker reads while all attached markets are closed, while interval-only and event-driven channels remain ungated ([#1253](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1253)); Run Detail scrolls and clamps long prompts, then collapses them again when switching runs ([#1258](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1258)); non-backtest runs route to Studio instead of a blank dashboard, and an empty trade-artifact array no longer hides a populated `trade_log` ([#1259](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1259)).

- **2026-08-29** 🛑 **A kill switch that skipped its own action, and a crypto pair that resolved to a different coin**: when a halted channel's broker reads failed — the adapter returns an error envelope instead of raising, and the sweep iterated it as a list of orders — the sweep marked itself fired anyway. The cancel-and-flatten the kill switch exists to perform was silently skipped for that episode, and nothing retried it. It now latches only once a broker write has been attempted, claims each halt episode exclusively so two runners cannot duplicate a close, and no longer reads a broker rejection wrapped in a transport-level success as accepted ([#1244](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1244)). Separately, asking for `ETH-USDT` returned `AETHUSDT-USD` — Aave Ethereum USDT, a different asset — because symbol search never covered exchange pairs and Yahoo's nearest string won. Exact pairs now resolve against the venue catalogs, which are public and need no broker account ([#1242](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1242), closes [#1234](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1234)). **New:** built-in connectors publish a machine-readable onboarding contract, so `vibe-trading connector setup` and the Portfolio connection center drive one generic flow, secrets kept per connection in the OS keyring ([#1250](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1250)). **Fixed:** stream retries escalate and honour `Retry-After` ([#1208](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1208)); a sleeve whose target rounds below one lot is reported instead of silently trading zero times ([#1235](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1235)); and an explicit benchmark is measured over the evaluated window, not the fetched one, so yesterday's warm-up boundary no longer compares two periods.

- **2026-08-28** 📏 **Backtests that crashed, and backtests that quietly graded a year you never asked for**: every cross-market backtest died on v0.1.14 — the runner deliberately passes `bars_per_year=None` for a basket spanning markets, and the new risk x-ray called `math.sqrt` on it. Two more consumers had the same gap; all four now resolve `None` through one shared span-derived factor ([#1239](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1239), closes [#1237](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1237)). The quieter one: a long-lookback strategy needs bars from *before* the period you asked about, so the agent moved `start_date` back a year to feed MA200 — and then graded that year. A run billed as ten years reported eleven, with the extra year's trades, CAGR and benchmark folded in, nothing raised, and the metrics internally consistent. `warmup_bars` (or `evaluation_start_date`) now separates the data window from the evaluation window: warm-up bars prime the indicators and reach nothing else ([#1240](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1240)). **New:** `quantlib` gains Heston (1993) stochastic-volatility pricing, Hierarchical Risk Parity, Gaussian and Archimedean copulas, microstructure estimators (VPIN, Roll, Amihud, Kyle) and finite-difference barrier Greeks — 306 tested functions across 23 modules ([#1195](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1195)–[#1198](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1198), [#1203](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1203)). **Fixed:** eight skill reference links pointed at paths `read_file` cannot open, so those documents silently failed to load.

- **2026-08-27** 🛑 **The kill-switch sweep now survives restarts and stops trusting a flaky broker**: during a halt, the cancel-and-flatten sweep counted any broker response as success — but the MCP adapter turns a failed call into a `{"status": "error"}` envelope, so a dropped connection produced a compliant-looking audit trail while the resting order stayed live; error envelopes now fail closed in both passes ([#1232](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1232)). The sweep's fired-once latch also lived only in memory: a restart with flatten orders still working replayed the whole sweep — a fresh market order per position, enough to flip a long book net short; the latch is now persisted next to the HALT sentinel and bound to its halt episode, so clearing and re-tripping still re-arms it ([#1233](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1233)). **New:** every market's data-source fallback order is visible and reorderable in *Settings → Data Source Priority* — hot-applied, persisted per market (`MARKET_DATA_ORDER_*`), and strictly a reordering: adding or dropping sources is refused, and without an override the defaults are untouched ([#1231](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1231)); Binance USD-M reconciliation results now land as tamper-evident drift evidence artifacts — strict JSON, fail-closed on incomplete or unsupported snapshots, no order surface ([#1230](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1230), toward [#1030](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1030)).

- **2026-08-26** ♻️ **A live Alpaca order that loses its broker response stops being a mystery, and gold backtests stop being frictionless**: the order gate now durably owns every Alpaca submission before the broker write, recovers the outcome by exact `client_order_id` only, attributes fills against the signed position delta, and HALTs on any contradiction — recovery never resubmits ([#1213](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1213), [#1221](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1221), [#1222](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1222)). **Fixed:** metals used FX pip/lot conventions, making gold's spread ~1,460× too cheap and rounding positions under 1,000 oz to zero ([#1226](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1226)); Futu HKD holdings were valued as USD, overstated by roughly the USD/HKD rate ([#1228](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1228)); Shadow Account read PnL keys the runner never emits, so every successful backtest reported PnL = 0.00 ([#1217](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1217)); streamed LLM calls never requested usage, under-reporting swarm output tokens ~18–36× ([#1225](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1225)). **New:** opt-in read-only Binance USD-M account snapshots — two allowlisted signed reads, no order surface ([#1229](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1229), toward [#1030](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1030)); portfolio OAuth reconnects run in a bounded subprocess that cannot strand the web process or the callback port ([#1211](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1211)).

- **2026-08-25** 🛡️ **Two live-gate fail-opens closed, and purged CV stops wiping the training set between test blocks**: Alpaca shorts booked as *positive* exposure (`qty` is a magnitude, direction lives in `side`), so selling more loosened `max_total_exposure_usd` instead of tightening it — quantity is now signed on both the TAP JSON and direct-SDK paths ([#1209](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1209)); OKX/Futu reads flattened a rejected API call into "empty book, `status: ok`", letting the mandate gate evaluate limits against nothing — they now return the error envelope the gate fails closed on ([#1212](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1212)). Both are Phase 0 of the audit roadmap in [#1207](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1207). **Fixed:** combinatorial purged CV treated non-contiguous test blocks as one span, purging every training observation between them; segments now purge individually and an emptied fold raises ([#1204](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1204)); the credit-risk functions refuse NaN/inf inputs instead of returning NaN scores or a "grey" verdict ([#1215](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1215), closes [#1214](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1214)). **New:** swarm workers retry with capped equal-jitter backoff ([#1210](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1210), toward [#1208](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1208)), and `vibe-trading --swarm-retry <run_id>` / `/swarm retry` reruns a failed run, keeping completed tasks with `--resume` ([#1194](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1194)).

- **2026-08-24** 🔗 **IBKR's official MCP goes from "lists tools" to a working read-only portfolio source, and scheduling gets an agent tool that cannot act alone**: [#1178](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1178) fixed the URL, but IBKR's gateway still rejected FastMCP's stock OAuth client registration before login. An IBKR-scoped OAuth provider — browser-profile headers, `token_endpoint_auth_method: none`, a stable callback port, and stale-registration recovery, applied only when the MCP host is `api.ibkr.com` — completes authorization ([#1186](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1186)), and the live-account-verified `get_account_summary` / `get_account_positions` tools now back the generic account/position reads, making `ibkr-live-official-mcp-readonly` an eligible `/portfolio` source ([#1190](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1190), closes [#1126](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1126)). **New:** the agent sees exactly one scheduling tool, `scheduled_research` — its `propose_create`/`propose_cancel` never touch the job store until you confirm on the surface you are on (Web card, CLI `y/N`, or an exact `confirm`/`确认` reply in IM), delivery targets are opaque operator-configured refs that never expose a raw chat/user id, and a job past its `end_at` expires instead of firing again ([#1187](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1187)). **Fixed:** the comps and three-statement engines now refuse non-finite inputs everywhere they enter the arithmetic — a NaN peer metric had been *included* in the multiple distribution and dragged the median to NaN, and `abs(nan) > tolerance` is `False`, so a NaN balance sheet sailed through the hard balance check ([#1184](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1184), closes [#1183](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1183)); `get_market_data` validates codes, dates, source and interval before burning the loader fallback chain on a malformed call, and its source enum stopped silently rejecting six registered loaders ([#1185](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1185)); Feishu QR login now persists the app credentials it receives exactly once — atomically, owner-only — instead of reporting a success that did not survive the process ([#1188](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1188)); the risk-analysis skill doc's historical-VaR order statistic now matches the code ([#1189](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1189)).

- **2026-08-23** 🔌 **The IBKR MCP seed named the wrong URL, and closing one LLM adapter closed them all**: The seeded official IBKR read-only MCP profile, the README and `SKILL.md` all pointed at `https://api.ibkr.com/v1/api/mcp`; IBKR's own AI-integration page publishes `https://api.ibkr.com/v1/api/mcp-public`, and the seed, all six READMEs and `SKILL.md` now name it — re-run `vibe-trading connector configure ibkr-live-official-mcp-readonly --yes` if your `agent.json` still carries the old URL. The OAuth client-registration step that IBKR's gateway rejects is still open in [#1126](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1126) ([#1178](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1178)). **Fixed:** `ChatLLM.close()` closed LangChain's process-wide cached HTTPX clients, so one finished title-generation or image-vision call left every later request failing with "client has been closed" until a restart — only transports Vibe-Trading created itself are closed now ([#1182](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1182)); a service restart mid-reply dropped the streamed text and left the attempt *running* forever — partial replies are now checkpointed and reconciled as an explicit *interrupted* transcript entry on the next start ([#1180](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1180)). **New:** Web chat attaches up to five files per turn through the picker, drag-and-drop, or clipboard paste ([#1179](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1179)). Thanks [@c020627](https://github.com/c020627) and [@AirHua-byte](https://github.com/AirHua-byte)!
- **2026-08-22** 💼 **A Portfolio page — your holdings across brokers, read-only**: Pick any read-only connector profiles (connection instances over `account.read` + `positions.read`; the IBKR official-MCP profile is not yet eligible) and the new `/portfolio` page aggregates them into immutable snapshots with per-source provenance, USD/CNY valuation, CSV export and a history chart. A source that fails to refresh is reported as an **error and excluded from the totals** — never carried forward — and the snapshot is marked incomplete. The `portfolio_summary` agent tool returns `risk_xray_args` that feed the existing `portfolio_risk_xray`, and `vibe-trading portfolio show|refresh|sources` prints the same snapshot in the terminal. Read-only connector plugins you write yourself live under `~/.vibe-trading/connectors/` (a manifest declaring any write capability is rejected; secrets go to the OS keyring via the `[keyring]` extra), and nothing on this path can place an order ([#1072](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1072), toward [#1171](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1171)). **Fixed:** thirteen Alpha Zoo factors forward-filled a missing close before computing returns, turning a data gap into a finite "0% return" — the gap now stays `NaN` ([#1172](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1172)); independent MCP clients on one http/sse server shared a single fallback research-goal session ([#1173](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1173)); memory GC and compression left stale FTS rows and orphaned relation sidecars ([#1174](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1174)); `cancel_run()` never reached a swarm worker already streaming — the stop now interrupts the stream, skips that turn's tool calls and lands as a *cancelled* task ([#1175](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1175)); MCP `get_research_reports` dropped `beginTime`/`endTime` ([#1176](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1176)); `get_options_chain` answered a wrong-cycle expiration with `ok: true` and another date's contracts ([#1177](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1177)).

- **2026-08-21** ⏱️ **Runs that hung forever**: A `bash` timeout killed the shell but not the grandchildren holding its pipe handles, so a run sat "running" for 20+ minutes. Commands now spawn in their own process group, a timeout kills the whole tree, a stall watchdog ends a run making no forward progress, and compaction stopped discarding the model's own verification records ([#1169](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1169)). **Fixed:** multi-year Tencent history silently truncated at 500 bars ([#1154](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1154)). **New:** swarm runs replay only their failed subgraph ([#1158](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1158), closes [#1157](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1157)); Market Watch shows each monitor's latest verdict inline ([#1156](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1156), closes [#943](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/943)); `quantlib` reaches 286 tested functions ([#1159](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1159)–[#1168](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1168)).

- **2026-08-20** 🚀 **v0.1.14 released** ([Release notes](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/releases/tag/v0.1.14), `pip install -U vibe-trading-ai`): 272 commits and 74 merged pull requests since 0.1.13. **The headline is that a finished backtest is now something you can read rather than a folder of CSVs.** Run Detail grows four tabs — **Factor Research** (IC series with its mean line, IC statistics, quantile-group equity, and a pairwise IC correlation matrix that existed nowhere before), **Positions** (weight pie/treemap on a date slider, sector net-exposure bars, weight-evolution area — the pie is gross composition and the bars are net, so a long/short pair in one sector nets to zero on the bars while both legs stay visible on the pie), **Tearsheet** (monthly-returns heatmap, annual bars, top-5 drawdowns annotated onto the equity curve), and an interactive **research dashboard** with KPIs, benchmark-relative equity, rolling Sharpe and the full trade ledger. All four read artifacts a run already writes — no new pipeline. A new **Options Lab** page adds an expiry payoff diagram, a spot×IV scenario matrix, portfolio Greeks and a live options chain, computed through the same test-pinned engine the MCP tools use. **Install:** Intel Macs can `pip install vibe-trading-ai` again — `smartmoneyconcepts` pulled in `llvmlite`, which ships no macOS x86_64 wheel from 0.46 on, so every Intel install became a CMake source build; it is now the opt-in `[smc]` extra and the stale `<3.14` cap is gone ([#1035](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/discussions/1035)). **New:** evidence-gated **Strategy Discovery** across the Alpha Zoo and the SDM store, with a population path, read-time freshness (`fresh`/`aging`/`stale`) and stale rows failing closed out of recommendations; scheduled research that **delivers itself** through a leased outbox and persists each monitor's verdict for the Market Watch list; seven read-only **Futu** endpoints; **Vietnam (HOSE)** as a backtest market; offline **USD-M account reconciliation**; **Novita AI** and **GitHub Copilot** providers; a hosted **MetaTrader 5** data source; **Spanish** and **German** locales; and MCP grows to 74 tools. **Correctness:** the test suite stopped escaping into your real config root, where a full run had been appending synthetic `order_rejected` records to the live hash-chained audit ledger; `build_registry()` no longer returns a short tool list in silence; `xirr` survives long-horizon discount underflow and DCF refuses non-finite inputs instead of returning a negative share price; `.VN` symbols stopped executing under China A-share rules; the backtest archive stopped mixing two runs' artifacts; and a broad grounding pass ended a class of false refusals on dates, ordered lists, identity constants in rate formulas, and order lines read as quotes.

- **2026-08-19** 🔌 **Stalled runs, a per-task connection leak, and Intel Macs that could not install**: A silent provider used to freeze a run — `VIBE_TRADING_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 300s) now bounds the call, and tool-call markup is never released as a final answer ([#1105](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1105)). Every swarm task leaked a pooled HTTP connection ([#1145](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1145), closes [#1141](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1141)). Also fixed: `vibe-trading show <run_id>` crashing ([#1147](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1147), closes [#1146](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1146)), overwritten in-flight deliveries ([#1140](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1140)), dropped backtest validation evidence ([#1139](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1139)), MCP paging ([#1137](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1137), [#1138](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1138)), and non-finite prediction-market fields ([#1136](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1136)). **New:** seven read-only Futu endpoints ([#1135](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1135)) and an explicit `Inferred` chip on guessed strategy titles ([#1134](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1134)). **Install:** `smartmoneyconcepts` is now the `[smc]` extra — the `llvmlite` it pulled in ships no macOS x86_64 wheel, turning every Intel Mac install into a cmake source build ([#1035](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/discussions/1035)); the `<3.14` cap goes with it.

- **2026-08-18** 🈶 **Correct reports stopped being refused, and backtests stopped trading noise**: `\b` is Unicode-aware, so `最` counts as a word character and `(2026-07-14最低)` had no boundary after the day — the date survived the mask and `2026`, `7` and `14` reached the OHLC check as prices no observed range can contain ([#1132](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1132), closes [#1122](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1122)). Four refusals of the same family went with it: a dash-form trading day (`08-10(一)`), a level stated as a range leaving `-20` behind, a GTC line (`100 @ $3.50`) read as two observed quotes, and a report-style date cell that matched no evidence row at all. **Backtests:** `position_adjustment="hold"` dropped a requested resize in silence, and `"rebalance"` had no drift band — measured, a 0.01% daily move re-pinned a position on 19 of 30 bars, so a strategy with its own `rebalance_freq` traded every bar regardless. Dropped requests are now reported, and `rebalance_tolerance` is the band practitioners mean by "rebalance when weights move more than X", defaulting to `0.0` so no existing run changes. Nineteen industry-neutralized alpha101 alphas had been skipped on every SP500 bench run for want of a sector tag that was already in the table the constituents come from. **New:** a Market Watch monitor can push its briefing to an IM channel once the run finishes, through a persisted outbox that a restart cannot lose and a concurrent sweep cannot double-send ([#942](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/942)); **German is the seventh UI language** ([#1117](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1117)); `run_dcf` refuses non-finite inputs instead of returning a plausible negative share price ([#1121](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1121), closes [#1120](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1120)); the MCP `get_market_data` response carries the `_provenance` its own docstring promised ([#1131](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1131)); a tool module that fails to import is named rather than quietly shrinking the registry ([#1129](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1129), closes [#1124](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1124)); and offline USD-M account reconciliation compares local risk state with an exchange observation without opening a connection ([#1106](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1106)). **Also:** importing `backtest.runner` no longer loads a `.env` into the process, which had made a local full-suite run untrustworthy on any machine that has one ([#1123](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1123)).

- **2026-08-17** 🔒 **The test suite stopped writing into your real config root — including the live audit ledger**: Running the project's own suite appended fabricated `order_rejected` records to `~/.vibe-trading/live/audit.jsonl`, an append-only, hash-chained ledger whose entire value is that its entries cannot be manufactured, and on Windows left a corrupted chain file behind. `conftest.py` had no config-root sandbox at all, so every module that baked `Path.home() / ".vibe-trading"` at import time resolved against the real home on **any** platform — Windows was worse only because `Path.home()` reads `%USERPROFILE%` there and ignores `$HOME`, leaving the isolation idiom the suite had been using inert. Home is now redirected before collection, the sandbox owns a single knob so per-test isolation still wins, and session end asserts the real ledgers are byte-identical instead of merely checking that the redirect was installed ([#1118](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1118), closes [#1116](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1116)). Also: `xirr` and `money_weighted_return` raised `ZeroDivisionError` on horizons past ~51 years, where the discount factor underflows to zero — exactly the long, irregular streams XIRR exists for ([#1119](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1119)); and a backtest archived into an active run merged with the previous one's artifacts, so a single report could describe two different backtests while `/runs/{id}` listed the leftovers as its own ([#1094](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1094)). Thanks [@lorenzozanee](https://github.com/lorenzozanee), [@straun-repo](https://github.com/straun-repo), and [@pengpengyi92](https://github.com/pengpengyi92)!
- **2026-08-16** 🔧 **Anthropic runs no longer die on recovery, and symbol search stops reporting empty results as healthy**: Recovery paths appended mid-conversation `system` messages that the Anthropic API rejects, killing the run — recovery steering now travels as user messages with inline `<system>` tags ([#1112](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1112), closes [#1109](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1109)). `search_symbol` returned zero candidates with both sources reporting `ok` for ticker+name queries, so identity never locked and every data tool refused; the Yahoo path now reports such queries `skipped` instead of a misleading `ok` ([#1114](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1114), closes [#1108](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1108)). Also: `LANGCHAIN_REASONING_EFFORT` is now honored on the Anthropic branch through a model allowlist ([#1115](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1115)); the Tencent loader recovers from `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` via the certifi CA bundle ([#1113](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1113)); the `revenue - cogs` gross-profit fallback is no longer dead code ([#1111](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1111)); and swarm workers use the shared truncation helper, so sub-agents always see the cut notice ([#1110](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1110)). Thanks [@lorenzozanee](https://github.com/lorenzozanee), [@straun-repo](https://github.com/straun-repo), [@x-lambda](https://github.com/x-lambda), [@cgycorey](https://github.com/cgycorey), and [@Shizoqua](https://github.com/Shizoqua)!
- **2026-08-15** 🛡️ **Safer desktop updates, reliable Windows packaging, and factor research in Run Detail**: The dormant updater boundary now retains owned-process evidence for cleanup retries, probes TCP listeners instead of HTTP health, reserves recovery journals atomically, binds Authenticode and hashes to the same staged bytes, and rechecks immediately before launch ([#1101](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1101)). Windows packaging now owns bounded, checksum-verified Electron downloads and extracts the pinned GTK asset as data through 7-Zip instead of executing its flaky legacy installer; native Windows CI covers exit codes, timeouts, runtime assembly, NSIS, and packaged startup ([#1104](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1104), closes [#1093](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1093)). Run Detail gains IC series and statistics, quantile equity, and IC correlation with bounded artifact traversal and finite JSON payloads ([#1099](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1099), closes [#1100](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1100)); universal hash locks are verified natively on Linux, macOS ARM64, and Windows ([#1102](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1102), closes [#1089](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1089)). Thanks [@QCYTSN](https://github.com/QCYTSN) and [@shadowinlife](https://github.com/shadowinlife)!
- **2026-08-14** ⚙️ **A reasoning setting that did nothing, and runs that stopped while they could still recover**: `LANGCHAIN_REASONING_EFFORT` was silently a no-op for almost every provider — only direct OpenAI ever received it, so setting `high` on DeepSeek changed nothing and said so nowhere. Effort now reaches both transports through each adapter's own field: Chat Completions by default, the Responses API when `LANGCHAIN_USE_RESPONSES_API=true`. The providers given a top-level `reasoning_effort` are a verified allowlist rather than everything that speaks the OpenAI wire format — an endpoint that validates its request body strictly rejects an unknown key and fails the call, so the cost of guessing wrong is every request, not a missing setting ([#1025](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1025)). The grounding gate also stops handing back "confirm and continue" while a deterministic read-only recovery is still available: an unresolved instrument now drives `search_symbol` → `get_market_data` on its own bounded budget instead of spending the run's iterations and failing closed ([#1092](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1092), closes [#1081](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1081)). **New:** an **Options Lab** page — multi-leg payoff diagram, spot × IV scenario matrix, portfolio Greeks and a live chain, computed by the existing payoff tool and `quantlib` rather than a second implementation of the math ([#1096](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1096)); a **backtest tearsheet** tab with a monthly-returns heatmap, annual returns and top-N drawdown episodes ([#1091](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1091)); **tickerall** as the 25th market-data source — hosted MetaTrader 5 forex/metals bars with no local terminal on any OS, explicit-only so a broker key is never a silent fallback target, and a truncated history window is an error rather than a quietly short series ([#968](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/968), closes [#897](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/897)); and **Novita AI** plus **GitHub Copilot** as built-in providers ([#1059](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1059), [#990](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/990)). eToro gains asset-class browsing by instrument type, and copy trading now refuses a demo account with a stated reason instead of failing obscurely ([#1070](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1070)).

- **2026-08-13** 🎯 **Backtest reports show the book that actually filled**: `positions.csv` held the optimiser's *target* weights, so a report could claim 80% exposure while lot rounding, fees, or a blocked order left the portfolio near 20% — and those targets also fed the invested-weight metrics and the risk x-ray. Fills now go to `positions.csv`, requests to `target_positions.csv` ([#1082](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1082)). Run Detail gains a **research dashboard** at `?view=dashboard` ([#1084](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1084)), and **Spanish is the sixth UI language** ([#1087](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1087)). Also: `get_research_reports` was returning HTTP 400 for every A-share symbol ([#1077](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1077)); IBKR quotes separate the tier requested from the one applied ([#1075](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1075)); `.env.partial` is written atomically ([#1086](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1086)); the Docker workflow pins actions to commits and hash-locks channel SDKs ([#1088](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1088)); and the grounding gate stops reading support/resistance ladders and all-time highs as observed prices ([#1060](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1060)).

- **2026-08-12** 📏 **A-share volume no longer jumps 100× when the fallback source changes**: Five sources in the A-share fallback chain reported board lots while BaoStock reported shares, and because the serving provenance carried no unit, a fallback could silently rescale every volume-based signal. Loaders now declare volume units per market, provenance exposes the unit of the source that actually served each symbol, BaoStock converts shares to board lots at the loader boundary, cache v4 prevents pre-fix entries from resurfacing, and a live-data cross-source regression requires settled-day values to agree within 1% ([#1065](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1065), [#1067](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1067), closes [#1062](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1062)). The ten-PR correctness pass also gives eToro complete runtime status and a five-locale SDK-connected UI ([#1051](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1051)); makes scheduled-run DELETE return a truly empty 204 ([#1068](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1068)); renders Alpaca's direct-SDK account payload in the CLI ([#1073](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1073)); normalizes Ollama roots to `/v1` at the credential boundary used by the real model constructor ([#1074](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1074)); turns Docker Codex OAuth stdin EOF into actionable TTY guidance ([#1054](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1054), closes [#1050](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1050)); stops Markdown ordered-list markers such as `1.` from becoming unsupported numeric claims ([#1063](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1063)); makes two-character memory queries such as `GE` behave the same with or without FTS5 ([#1071](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1071)); and prices zero-volatility European options from discounted forward intrinsic value, restoring exercise-side logic and put-call parity ([#1066](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1066)).

- **2026-08-11** 🧠 **Compaction stops dropping conversation content, and a swarm retry can no longer delete its own run**: Auto-compaction sliced the serialized history at a hard 80,000 characters before summarizing, so anything past that cut reached neither the summary call nor the preserved tail — it vanished with no error raised, against the function's own "zero info decay" guarantee, and the slice landed mid-object so the summarizer was handed invalid JSON. History is now packed on message boundaries and folded chunk by chunk through the existing iterative template; a single message too large for one chunk becomes labelled fragments instead of a truncation, and an empty model reply no longer wipes the summary accumulated so far (closes [#1055](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1055)). The new retry-time artifact cleanup ran `shutil.rmtree` on `run_dir/artifacts/<agent_id>`, where `agent_id` arrives unvalidated from a preset and user presets load from `~/.vibe-trading/swarm/presets/`, so an id of `..` resolved to the run directory itself — the path is now refused unless it is one safe segment resolving inside that run's artifacts directory. Plus `technical_indicators` RSI moving to the Wilder-EWM convention its own docstring already claimed, where a plain rolling mean can shift a reading across the 30/70 boundary ([#1056](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1056)); `excess_return` re-derived from the corrected benchmark total so the two fields stop contradicting each other inside one metrics dict ([#1058](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1058)); swarm deliverable validation rejecting `ok`/`success`-keyed raw tool envelopes passed off as analysis ([#1052](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1052)); a retried worker no longer inheriting the failed attempt's `report.md` ([#1053](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1053)); and worker prompts ordered so the agent-invariant blocks form one cache-eligible prefix ([#1057](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1057)). Thanks [@Shizoqua](https://github.com/Shizoqua) and [@Echoandelementwebsites](https://github.com/Echoandelementwebsites).
- **2026-08-10** 🚀 **v0.1.13 released** ([Release notes](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/releases/tag/v0.1.13), `pip install -U vibe-trading-ai`): 408 commits and 162 merged pull requests since 0.1.12 — the largest release so far. **The headline is a fix, not a feature: the identity gate stops refusing answers it already had the evidence for.** A well-formed question would spend minutes on real tool calls and then return *"cannot safely confirm instrument identity or price evidence"*. The causes: `.SS` and `.SH` were treated as different instruments, so **every Shanghai ticker was permanently ambiguous**; a failed side query could demote an already-locked identity; Yahoo's HTTP 400 on every CJK query was recorded as a source *failure* instead of "not listed here"; a hardcoded per-tool whitelist blocked 11 of the 17 documented argument spellings; Chinese answers were rejected for writing `雅虎` or `元` rather than the ASCII loader name; and a thousands separator split `¥1,309.22` so `1` was compared against the observed range. Conceptual questions and comparison reports no longer dead-end either. A quote outside recorded OHLC evidence is still refused. **New:** `src/quantlib` — 249 tested functions across 17 modules (options, bonds, credit, econometrics, VaR/CVaR/EVT, attribution, event studies, purged CV) reachable from the CLI, Web UI, REST API and MCP through the read-only `quantlib_call`, so skills import finance math instead of carrying formulas in markdown; a **valuation engine** (`run_dcf` / `run_comps` / three-statement) whose one rule is that a missing input makes a model NOT RUNNABLE rather than silently defaulted; an **entity + irregular cash-flow spine** (XIRR / MOIC / DPI / TVPI, TWR / Modified Dietz via `cashflow_performance`) kept deliberately parallel to the bar engines; **governance in every run** — a hash manifest over prompt, skills, tool registry and package versions, plus a hash-chained fsynced audit ledger where even a self-rehashed edit is caught one record later; four read-only data tools on free public sources (SEC **13F** with quarter-over-quarter diffs, **ETF look-through** where a CSI-300 tracker resolves to 342 positions covering 98.66% of net assets instead of the quarterly top ten, **prediction markets** as labelled implied probability, and **arXiv/OpenAlex** with source-anchored claims); six institutional commands (`/comps` `/dcf` `/attrib` `/memo` `/earnings` `/screen`); investor lenses as a standalone skill; five scheduled-research playbooks; a **desktop Electron shell** with checksum-pinned Windows packaging and `safeStorage`; **eToro** as the 13th broker connector; **Korea (KRX)** as the 9th backtest engine; an **OpenBB Workspace bridge**; Canadian equities end to end; and `sentiment`, `technical_indicators`, `options_payoff`, `orderbook_depth`, ModelScope and `vibe-trading update`. **Correctness:** SEC periods are keyed on their `(start, end)` span — annual figures had been returning a single quarter, a 4.2× understatement; Tushare A-share prices are corporate-action adjusted, where a raw return across an ex-date was off by up to 47 percentage points; `bar_returns` no longer records a trading halt as a 0% move; annualisation covers all 24 data sources; a sandbox gap is closed where generated code could import the broker layer or reach `socket`/`subprocess` through a renamed binding; and mixed-currency composite backtests are refused instead of summed into one equity curve.

- **2026-08-09** 🪟 **Secure Windows packaging, Canada markets, ModelScope, and Alpha Zoo over MCP**: Windows desktop packaging now assembles a checksum-pinned embedded Python 3.12 runtime and x64 NSIS review/signing paths, plus Electron `safeStorage` for an allowlisted credential set. The renderer can set or clear secrets but never read them; plaintext configuration migrates once; decrypted values reach only the owned backend; and both unsigned review and signed builds fail closed on the wrong signature state. No installer artifact was published from this PR ([#1015](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1015)). Canadian equities now work end to end: `.TO`/`.V` symbols are classified in CAD, route through Yahoo → yfinance → local fallback, execute under Canada-specific GlobalEquity rules, benchmark against `XIC.TO`, and refuse mixed-currency aggregation. Strict USD-M historical backtests can also opt into `position_adjustment=rebalance` while preserving collateral, funding, fees, realized P&L, liquidation behavior, and immutable fill evidence across increases and reductions ([#1024](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1024), [#1019](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1019), closes [#952](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/952)). ModelScope joins the built-in providers through its official OpenAI-compatible hosted-inference endpoint, with `Qwen/Qwen3.5-27B` as the default ([#1011](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1011)); the new `vibe-trading update` distinguishes wheel installs from editable/source checkouts, installs the exact release it checked, and verifies fresh metadata without downgrading ([#1020](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1020)); and `alpha_zoo` plus bounded `alpha_bench` now reach MCP (64 tools), with horizon/result/output-path limits and safe report creation ([#979](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/979)). Verified Python and frontend lock refreshes also update grouped dependencies, `postcss`, and `akshare` ([#1021](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1021), [#1023](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1023), [#1026](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1026), [#1027](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1027)).

- **2026-08-08** 🧱 **Desktop shell, eToro, atomic rebalancing, and a broad reliability pass**: A source-first Electron host now owns the existing backend lifecycle — random loopback port, per-launch secret, five-locale startup recovery, and owned-process cleanup — while eToro joins with path-separated demo/real profiles; live risk-increasing actions remain mandate-gated and audited, and API capability surfaces are authenticated under enforced CSP ([#923](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/923), [#989](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/989), [#961](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/961)). Backtests gain opt-in atomic same-direction rebalancing with immutable fill evidence; Shadow splits mixed markets by settlement currency without invented FX aggregation and honors the configured runtime root; indicators use consecutive unsampled history; negative-equity drawdown and empty insolvent cross accounts are handled correctly ([#951](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/951), [#997](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/997), [#1017](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1017), [#1005](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1005), [#958](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/958), [#959](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/959)). OpenAI Codex OAuth gets a separate synchronized credential store and one-shot 401 recovery; proxy opt-out covers sync and async clients; sandboxed runs retain their canonical root; scheduled research isolates malformed records and fixes interval-timezone validation; lowercase `4h` requests return true four-hour bars ([#1014](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1014), [#995](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/995), [#1012](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1012), [#1003](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1003), [#1004](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1004), [#1013](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1013)). QQ replies retain source message IDs, long model slugs remain readable, and the agent stops when evidence is sufficient ([#1008](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1008), [#1006](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1006), [#1010](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1010)).

- **2026-08-07** 🛡️ **Fewer false refusals, a closed sandbox gap, QVeris on MCP**: The grounding gate stops rejecting well-formed answers over numbers that were never prices — confidence scores, indicator readings, moving-average windows, year-less dates like `8/5`, percentage ranges, and a trading plan's own trigger levels (`close ≥ 6.45` is a condition, not a quote) — while a quote outside recorded OHLC evidence is still refused, and a price table dated `08-05` now matches its evidence instead of every cell coming back unavailable ([#1001](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/1001), [#983](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/983)). **Sandbox:** generated strategy code can no longer import the broker layer, nor reach `socket`/`subprocess`/`os.system`/`ctypes` through a renamed binding — both were accepted before, and `src.quantlib` still imports. **QVeris** discovery/inspect/execute join the MCP surface (62 tools), with the cost quote read from the marketplace instead of trusted from the caller ([#976](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/976), closes [#964](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/964), thanks [@shadowinlife](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/shadowinlife)). Plus HK market-data fallback routing repaired with a new Tencent HK source, yfinance crypto routed to the crypto engine, memory entries written and recovered with their `.md` suffix, MCP list/dict arguments tolerating JSON-string clients, and Portfolio Studio artifacts surfaced in run detail ([#1000](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/1000), [#970](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/970), [#984](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/984), [#993](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/993), [#980](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/980), [#982](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/982), [#966](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/966), [#973](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/973), thanks [@he-yufeng](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/he-yufeng), [@ngoanpv](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/ngoanpv), [@sambazhu](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/sambazhu)).
- **2026-08-06** 🧮 **A tested finance-math layer + valuation engine + irregular cash flows + wired-in governance**: `src/quantlib` replaces the formulas that lived as markdown inside skills with one tested implementation each — options, bonds, credit, econometrics, VaR/CVaR/EVT, attribution, event studies, multiple-testing control, purged cross-validation — 265 functions, reachable from the CLI, Web UI, REST API and MCP via the new read-only `quantlib_call` tool. A valuation engine (`run_dcf` / `run_comps` / three-statement) refuses to run on a missing input instead of silently defaulting it, and a new entity + cash-flow spine admits NAVs, capital calls, and coupons (XIRR/MOIC/DPI/TVPI and TWR/Modified Dietz via `cashflow_performance`; crypto L2 impact cost via `orderbook_depth`). Every run now writes a hash manifest, the audit ledger is hash-chained so tampering is detectable, and all 30 swarm presets were re-audited — a deliverable no granted tool can compute is now declared as such instead of invented.
- **2026-08-05** 🔭 **Institutional holdings, ETF look-through, prediction markets, research papers**: Four read-only data tools, all on free public sources — SEC 13F books with quarter-over-quarter position diffs; ETF constituents across markets (a CSI-300 tracker resolves to 342 positions covering 98.7% of net assets, not the quarterly top ten); event contracts as labelled implied probability; and arXiv/OpenAlex search that marks what a source does not state instead of inferring it. Plus five scheduled-research templates, six institutional commands (`/comps` `/dcf` `/attrib` `/memo` `/earnings` `/screen`), investor lenses as a standalone skill, and an agent core that traces every number back to the tool that produced it.
- **2026-08-04** 🔧 **Correctness pass: fundamentals, A-share prices, oversized results**: SEC reporting periods are now keyed on their `(start, end)` span — a 10-Q files the true quarter and the year-to-date frame under the same end date and fiscal period, so `period="annual"` had been returning a single quarter for AAPL FY2018–2020 (a 4.2× understatement) and every fiscal-Q4 slot in a quarterly series carried the full-year figure; `get_fundamentals("AAPL.US")` no longer answers `ok:true` with an all-null panel. Tushare A-share prices are now corporate-action adjusted in both the factor bench and backtests — a raw close-to-close return across an ex-date was off by up to 47 percentage points (300750.SZ, 2023-04-26) — and the CSI300 bench masks each date to its point-in-time index membership. Cross-market composite backtests refuse a mixed-currency code set instead of summing CNY, USD and KRW into one equity curve; option legs are marked at the volatility they were opened at, removing a fabricated day-zero P&L of up to +93% of premium; oversized tool results are paged by whole record with an explicit total instead of being cut mid-JSON; and `calc_metrics` reports tracking error and benchmark beta.
- **2026-08-03** ⏰ **Timezone-aware scheduled research + unblocked stock screening**: Scheduled jobs now take an optional IANA `timezone` and evaluate cron on that zone's wall clock, so a cadence survives DST — a spring-forward gap is skipped and a fall-back ambiguous time runs once — while cron fields gain comma lists and ranges (`1,3-5`), jobs without a timezone keep UTC semantics, and the web UI gains a **Scheduled** page in all five locales where it previously had no scheduling surface at all ([#954](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/954), closes [#953](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/953), thanks [@ngoanpv](https://github.com/ngoanpv)). A screening request no longer dead-ends: a many-candidate shortlist counts as an answer rather than a stalled resolution and retires once a candidate is locked, and price validation stops reading ticker digits, localized dates, share counts, and position costs as quoted prices — while still refusing any quote outside recorded OHLC evidence (closes [#955](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/955)). Agent memory also gets exact index-anchor matching and a respected result bound ([#956](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/956), [#957](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/957), thanks [@santhreal](https://github.com/santhreal)).
- **2026-08-02** 🧠 **Live model discovery, truthful runtime identity, and a verified dependency refresh**: Settings now discovers configured-provider models on demand with stable warning codes and five-locale controls, while each reply records and reloads the immutable provider/model/reasoning identity that actually served it—cleared safely when sessions change ([#924](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/924), thanks [@QCYTSN](https://github.com/QCYTSN)). Nine hash-locked Python updates plus `jsdom`/`postcss` also landed with exact-version imports, 330 focused tests, the production build, 373 frontend tests, full `main` CI, and Dependency Graph green ([#949](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/949), [#948](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/948)); the breaking MCP 2.0 bump remains unmerged pending a complete lock/runtime migration ([#950](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/950)).
- **2026-08-01** 🧮 **Options strategy analytics + market sentiment + auditable USD-M research**: A new options payoff workflow analytically calculates expiry P&L extrema, exact breakevens—including continuous zero-P&L intervals—engine-aligned entry commissions, and spot × IV scenarios through Agent and MCP ([#946](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/946), rebuilt from [#883](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/883), thanks @he-yufeng). The read-only `sentiment` tool scores arbitrary text locally and retrieves the crypto Fear & Greed Index without an API key ([#939](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/939), thanks @Robin1987China). Strict USD-M backtests now persist ordered fill, funding, risk, and liquidation events plus a fidelity summary, while rejecting unsupported 100× intervals ([#936](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/936), thanks @honginp). Reliability improvements also ensure symbol and venue resolution precedes market-data calls, final quoted prices are checked against recorded OHLC evidence, scheduled research retries transient failures, and nested MCP results serialize cleanly.
- **2026-07-31** 🔧 **USD-M liquidation lifecycle + technical indicators + user-level state dirs**: Opt-in `perpetual_strict` mode settles historical funding before fills and executes isolated/cross margin breaches as real liquidations ([#903](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/903), thanks @honginp). A read-only `technical_indicators` tool computes RSI/MACD/Bollinger/SMA/EMA through the existing loaders ([#921](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/921), refs [#920](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/920), thanks @Robin1987China). Sessions, runs, swarm runs, and uploads now live under `~/.vibe-trading` (relocatable via `VIBE_TRADING_HOME`) with a one-time automatic migration ([#925](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/925), closes [#904](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/904), thanks @MuggleJinx). Plus ten correctness fixes — Yahoo `.SS` classified as A-share, bare/prefix-style A-share codes, slash-delimited crypto pairs, `nan`/`inf` guards ([#919](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/919), [#926](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/926)–[#935](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/935), thanks @santhreal).
- **2026-07-30** 🎨 **Rebuilt WebUI + Korea (KRX) market + an OpenBB Workspace bridge**: The web UI lands its guided-minimalism overhaul — no first-frame flash, one durable activity object per turn with a live reasoning whisper and a reload-safe tool trail, LLM-written session titles, full five-locale parity. **Korea equity (KRX: KOSPI/KOSDAQ)** becomes the 9th backtest engine — execution-time ±30% band, long-only, 2026 0.20% transaction tax, optional `pykrx` loader ([#693](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/693), thanks @JungHoonGhae) — plus an **OpenBB Workspace bridge** ([#817](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/817), thanks @shugaoye) and a read-only **Taiwan snapshot** tool ([#848](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/848), thanks @TSENGCHIENFENG). Correctness: daily price bands are judged **at execution time**, not from the decision bar's close; a session runs one attempt at a time (HTTP 409) and a user stop is its own terminal state ([#676](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/676), thanks @tyj147454413-cmd). Plus durable traces ([#662](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/662)), secret-scrubbed tool results ([#675](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/675)), fail-closed tool arguments ([#913](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/913)/[#911](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/911), thanks @santhreal), direct-OpenAI `reasoning_effort` ([#755](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/755), thanks @1anter), and numeric guards across the risk x-ray / edge density / options engine ([#909](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/909)/[#908](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/908)/[#907](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/907)).
- **2026-07-29** 🔧 **Gap-safe returns + liquidation risk modeling + a risk x-ray in every run**: `bar_returns` no longer erases the real move across a trading halt longer than the forward-fill window — the resumption move was silently recorded as 0, understating volatility and inflating Sharpe — and an `inf` prior price can no longer read as a clean −100% ([#895](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/895), thanks @darkknight4563). Annualisation now covers **all 24 data sources** at every interval, with a coverage test that fails CI when a loader lands without entries ([#891](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/891), closes [#884](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/884), thanks @Robin1987China). USD-M perpetual research gains deterministic **isolated & cross margin liquidation** evaluation ([#889](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/889), thanks @honginp), and every portfolio backtest now emits **risk x-ray artifacts** (`risk_xray.json`/`.md`) with headline concentration/vol/drawdown metrics ([#900](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/900), thanks @he-yufeng). The `connector` CLI now loads `~/.vibe-trading/.env`, so env-sourced broker credentials resolve again ([#902](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/902), closes [#901](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/901), thanks @MuggleJinx). Plus indent-preserving channel message splits and skill-frontmatter parsing at EOF ([#867](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/867)/[#861](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/861), thanks @santhreal).

- **2026-07-28** 🔧 **Next-gen Claude models unblocked + sign-safe returns**: Claude models that deprecate the `temperature` field (opus-4-7, opus-5, sonnet-5) now work — the adapter drops the field when the API rejects it, retries once, and remembers the model, so no per-release patch is needed ([#890](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/890), closes [#856](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/856), thanks @yagnikpipaliya). Non-interactive `vibe-trading run` now injects a host session id: research-goal tools previously failed on every call while the run still reported success ([#885](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/885)). Buy-and-hold returns are sign-safe — a near-zero prior close no longer explodes the compounded benchmark, and an exact-zero close no longer yields `inf`/`nan` ([#872](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/872), thanks @darkknight4563). The frontend moves to **Node 22 + React Router 8**, clearing a high-severity advisory.
- **2026-07-27** 🔧 **Correlation integrity + vn.py 4.0 export repair + an encoding batch**: The rolling correlation matrix no longer forward-fills missing closes — a halted session was being scored as a fabricated 0% return against the peer's real move, distorting the matrix ([#873](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/873), thanks @ddy4633). The **vn.py export** skill is repaired for the vn.py 4.x layout, where `vnpy.app.cta_strategy` no longer exists upstream — templates now import from `vnpy_ctastrategy` ([#869](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/869), thanks @y85998607). Plus a six-fix batch: UTF-16 BOM decoding in the document reader and trade-journal CSVs, currency symbols stripped before numeric coercion, `BTCUSDT`-style symbols inferred as crypto, lowercase `1h`/`1d` intervals annualized correctly, and CJK characters preserved in skill directory slugs ([#862](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/862), [#863](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/863), [#864](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/864), [#865](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/865), [#866](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/866), [#868](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/868), thanks @santhreal).

Actions and five frontend dependencies were also refreshed ([#850](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/850)–[#852](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/852)).

MCP dataclass results no longer crash on a false `Circular reference detected` ([#849](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/849), thanks @Echoandelementwebsites), and `alpha bench` CLI/HTML forward the `_meta` survivorship disclosure ([#841](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/841), closes [#797](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/797), thanks @AmirF194). Plus 12 correctness fixes across journals, connectors, and channels ([#799](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/799)–[#810](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/810), thanks @santhreal), and a real account label in CLI balances ([#843](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/843), closes [#846](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/846), thanks @Robin1987China).

Correctness: the daily-bar validator can opt in to **non-positive prices** — opening on negative bars while still rejecting zero ([#816](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/816), closes [#571](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/571), thanks @darkknight4563). Plus a 19-PR loader **interval-normalization sweep**: lowercase `1h/4h/1d/1w` aliases accepted everywhere, unsupported intervals now fail fast instead of silently returning daily bars, Yahoo `4H` maps to `1h`, and MT5 accepts `1W/1M` ([#812](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/812)–[#838](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/838), thanks @santhreal), a trade-journal fix for Eastmoney Excel-serial dates ([#811](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/811), thanks @santhreal), and a README nav-anchor fix ([#840](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/840), thanks @dvirarad).
- **2026-07-23** 🔧 **Reliability sweep + strict alpha-bench surfaced + opt-in memory lifecycle**: A 22-PR contributor batch. A broad **reliability sweep** fixes timeframe handling end to end — yfinance `1M`→monthly (not minute), CCXT `1W`/`1M`, akshare/india-broker rejecting unsupported intervals instead of silent daily, and the Tiger/Alpaca/OKX/Shoonya/Longbridge connectors keeping `1H`/`4H` as hour bars — plus trade-journal Excel-date normalization (eastmoney float `YYYYMMDD`, Futu/Tonghuashun serial dates), finite-JSON `report_audit`, blank `holding_days` validation, and Feishu/CLI markdown table edges ([#778](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/778)–[#794](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/794), thanks @santhreal). **MT5** `trading_history` now coerces numpy scalars so JSON serialization no longer dies on `int64` ([#776](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/776), closes [#774](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/774), thanks @shadowinlife), and **PIT fundamentals** dedup restated rows and stop the snapshot regressing to an older fiscal period on a late restatement ([#772](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/772), closes [#771](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/771), thanks @klmtseng). New: **`alpha bench --strict`** finally wires the strict same-universe random-control + OOS gate that shipped unreachable since 0.1.9 ([#796](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/796), closes [#773](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/773), thanks @he-yufeng), an opt-in **memory lifecycle** (quality scoring, Ebbinghaus decay, archive-only GC — all off by default) ([#733](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/733), closes [#732](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/732), thanks @shadowinlife), and backtest **rebalance-notes** artifacts + turnover metrics ([#795](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/795), thanks @he-yufeng).
- **2026-07-22** 🚀 **v0.1.12 released** ([Release notes](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/releases/tag/v0.1.12), `pip install -U vibe-trading-ai`): The **correlation regime timeline** adds a `GET /correlation/regime` endpoint + an opt-in Correlation-tab strip — edge density run through a causal hysteresis state machine that marks FUSED market episodes, descriptive risk context rather than a signal ([#756](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/756), closes [#719](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/719), thanks @ebujinovch). Provider endpoint resolution now falls back to each provider's canonical base URL and gracefully handles non-SSE endpoints, fixing the native **zai** provider on glm-5.1 ([#758](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/758)). Plus a strict-JSON / finite-number **reliability sweep** across metrics, factors, pattern, session, and journal ([#761](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/761)–[#770](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/770), thanks @santhreal) and a Binance maintenance-bracket decouple that keeps `-PERP` backtests zero-credential ([#757](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/757), thanks @honginp). Rolls up ~90 fixes since 0.1.11.
- **2026-07-21** 🔧 **Data-loader completeness + a reliability fix sweep**: Partial market-data results now complete the missing symbols through the fallback chain and fail closed instead of silently shrinking the backtest universe ([#689](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/689), closes [#681](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/681), thanks @xkam7ar), and OKX bars use the `history-candles` endpoint with rate-limit retry for deep backfills ([#644](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/644), thanks @tyj147454413-cmd).

- **2026-07-14** 🌉 **Longbridge market data + modern MCP transport + provider reliability**: Longbridge joins the historical-data fallback layer with key-gated credentials, date-window splitting, strict completeness checks, and an opt-in SDK dependency; four China-market flow tools gain verified Tushare fallbacks, and negative final equity no longer crashes backtest metrics. The MCP server now supports Streamable HTTP, `write_file` safely recovers aliased or missing path arguments, hypothesis updates reject unsupported fields, and Correlation requests are authenticated. NVIDIA NIM is now a first-class provider across Web Settings and both CLI onboarding paths, with a versioned compatibility User-Agent to address the reported 403; Web Settings now writes to the canonical `~/.vibe-trading/.env`, migrates legacy configuration, and reports permission failures clearly, fixing the DeepSeek save-time 500 ([#534](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/534), closes [#516](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/516)/[#524](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/524); [#528](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/528)/[#529](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/529)).

We also landed the queued quick-win contributor fixes: loader `fetch()` signatures now match the protocol across OKX / Tushare / yfinance ([#437](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/437), thanks @shadowinlife), the CLI resume prompt preserves the first user message ([#448](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/448), closes [#447](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/447), thanks @morluto), Codex OAuth defaults to `openai-codex/gpt-5.4` ([#446](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/446), thanks @morluto), Kimi for Coding is available as a distinct provider ([#435](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/435), thanks @yxhuang), opencode provider mappings are wired ([#444](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/444), thanks @imsankz), and Tushare reference code fences now say `python` instead of `pyhton` ([#449](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/449), thanks @flash1234pku). Validation included focused server/CLI/provider/loader tests plus a Docker build and `/health` smoke.

- **2026-07-08** 💎 **Fundamental factor layer (Phase 1) + optional QVeris premium data + maintainer day**: PIT-safe SEC fundamentals now flow into daily factor panels — `fund:*` panel columns, filed-date anchoring with restatement and YTD-frame protection, and 4 new quality/value factors (registry now 460 alphas). Data routing gains an optional premium track: the 18 free sources stay the default, while QVeris unlocks 63+ providers via Settings → QVeris or `vibe-trading data mode paid` (see the QVeris section below). Also: `api_server` modularization completed (1,103 → 371 lines, [#424](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/424) closing [#331](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/331), thanks @shadowinlife), backtest `validation.json` no longer requires a pre-existing artifacts dir ([#429](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/429), thanks @isaveall), clearer `--swarm-run` errors ([#428](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/428), thanks @isaveall), and we reverted the governance stack that broke session chats ([#433](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/433), thanks @yxhuang for the precise diagnosis).

- **2026-07-07** ✅ **Contributor PR batch**: merged the queued contributor work for IM channel timeout configuration ([#413](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/413), thanks @SyntaxSawdust), Alpha Library social previews and the beginner tutorial ([#396](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/396), [#393](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/393), thanks @kadaliao), value-investing skills / tools / committee presets ([#407](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/407), thanks @sambazhu), zero-sized order-field handling in `trading_place_order` ([#417](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/417), thanks @irfanallana-oss), and timezone-aware UTC timestamps across session/API paths ([#397](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/397), thanks @mustafakamal88).

- **2026-07-06** 🧭 **Preflight hardening, API slices, and CN search fallback**: provider preflight no longer follows redirects ([#404](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/404), closes [#402](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/402), thanks @SyntaxSawdust), the remaining API routes moved into focused modules ([#387](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/387), superseding [#383](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/383)-[#386](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/386), thanks @shadowinlife), and CN web-search fallbacks now include Alibaba Cloud IQS ([#408](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/408), thanks @sambazhu). Maintainer cleanup added no-network fallback tests and EOF whitespace cleanup ([fbac74f](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/commit/fbac74f77bfed58dd7fc23d0f001c29190b4b2b6)); main CI is green ([run 28780619018](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/actions/runs/28780619018)).

- **2026-07-05** ✅ **Contributor PR queue closed + Windows baseline green**: merged the four non-draft PRs selected for today's maintainer pass. A-share mootdx batch pulls now let `KeyboardInterrupt` / `SystemExit` propagate instead of being swallowed by a bare `except` ([#399](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/399), closes [#398](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/398), thanks @shadowinlife). The Settings route slice and patched dependency floors are now merged under their original contributor PRs ([#382](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/382), [#390](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/390), thanks @shadowinlife and @aeonframework). Windows baseline compatibility now isolates loader caches, makes OAuth cache assertions platform-aware, skips one fork-only mock test on Windows, and bypasses proxies for MCP loopback fixtures ([#401](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/401), thanks @Elfsa-Miranda). Validation: `4701 passed, 47 skipped`.

- **2026-07-04** 🧩 **API route slices, tutorial docs, and dependency floors**: IM channel and Settings routes moved out of `api_server.py` into `src/api/channels_routes.py` and `src/api/settings_routes.py`, continuing the narrow [#331](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/331) modularization path from contributor work ([#379](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/379), [#382](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/382), thanks @shadowinlife). The wiki gained a Chinese beginner tutorial for non-finance readers ([#393](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/393), thanks @kadaliao), and dependency floors now keep Pillow / LangChain / LangGraph on the installable patched track ([#390](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/390), thanks @aeonframework).

- **2026-07-04** 🧹 **UTC timestamp cleanup for session and API paths**: tightened the #395 timestamp fix so session, goal, channel, and API timestamps now emit timezone-aware UTC values in explicit ISO form.

- **2026-07-03** 🛡️ **Robinhood MCP refresh + API modularization + SSRF guard**: Robinhood Agentic Trading now uses the current MCP tool names across generic reads, live-runner plumbing, default read-only seeds, and mandate-gate tests, while interactive startup honors the same `.env` search order as the provider loader (`~/.vibe-trading/.env` → `agent/.env` → `$CWD/.env`) ([#391](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/391), closes [#381](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/381) and [#380](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/380)). System routes (`/health`, `/correlation`, `/system/shutdown`, `/skills`, `/api`) moved into `src/api/system_routes.py` as the next narrow API modularization slice ([#378](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/378), thanks @shadowinlife). Channel media SSRF defenses now reject CGNAT/mesh/non-global targets and QQ media redirects-to-internal before fetching ([#389](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/389), thanks @hobostay).

- **2026-07-02** ⚡ **Factor acceleration + safer runtime boundaries**: hot rolling factor operators now use `bottleneck`/NumPy fast paths, alpha bench parallelism avoids repeated large-panel worker payloads, and base equity math has regression coverage ([#376](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/376), closes [#339](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/339), original work from [#342](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/342) by @shadowinlife). Upload and Shadow report routes moved out of the monolithic `api_server.py` as the first narrow API modularization slice while [#331](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/331) stays open ([#375](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/375), based on [#358](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/358), thanks @shadowinlife). Generated backtests now inherit only an allowlisted subprocess environment instead of the parent secrets surface ([#374](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/374), closes [#332](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/332)), and IM channels gained `/new` session reset plus case-insensitive pairing commands ([#372](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/372), closes [#371](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/371), thanks @shadowinlife).

- **2026-07-01** 🧹 **Security polish + tracker cleanup**: tightened API/Docker/frontend dev defaults, stabilized Settings channel and `zh-CN` edges, cleared frontend dependency/CSP alerts, and closed stale WhatsApp + paper-trading tracker items ([#338](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/338), [#351](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/351), [#349](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/349), [#365](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/365), [#367](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/367), [#350](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/350), [#335](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/335), [#283](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/283)).

- **2026-06-30** 💬 **IM channel runtime for research delivery**: Vibe-Trading can now attach the same agent session runtime to 16 built-in message adapters — WebSocket, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Matrix, WhatsApp, Signal, QQ/NapCat, WeChat/WeCom, Feishu/Lark, DingTalk, Teams, email, and Mochat. CLI (`vibe-trading channels status/start/stop/login/pairing`), REST (`/channels/status`, `/channels/start`, `/channels/stop`, `/channels/pairing/command`), and the Web UI Settings panel expose status, recovery hints, start/stop, and sender pairing; SDK-backed adapters stay behind extras such as `vibe-trading-ai[telegram]` or `vibe-trading-ai[channels]` ([#341](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/341)).

- **2026-06-29** 🛡️ **Live advisory safety + Trading 212 read-only connector + Windows/Gemini fixes**: live order guards now have an opt-in, broker-agnostic `PreTradeAdvisoryInterface` that records advisory reviews without bypassing the mandate gate, kill switch, or audit trail ([#328](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/328), closes [#317](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/317), thanks @shadowinlife). Trading 212 joins the connector layer with read-only account, positions, orders, history, and instrument-metadata support; `place_order` / `cancel_order` still hard-refuse until a structural paper/live boundary exists ([#321](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/321), closes [#309](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/309), thanks @mvanhorn). Windows startup avoids the pandas 3.0 `Timestamp` crash via the `<3.0.0` constraint ([#329](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/329), closes [#324](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/324), thanks @hannibal-lee); Gemini `thought_signature` dict-history replay was verified/fixed on `main` ([#318](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/318)); `.US` financial statements now route to SEC EDGAR instead of Eastmoney ([#325](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/325)); and the Alpha Library landing page got cache/date/selector/noscript/DNS-prefetch hardening while heavier CSP and social-card follow-ups stay tracked ([#323](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/323)).

- **2026-06-28** 🧰 **Cross-platform setup/dev + runtime and file-tool hardening**: `vibe-trading setup` and `vibe-trading dev` now handle Windows TypeScript builds, launch the backend from the right cwd, use the Vite 5899 port, and shut child processes down cleanly ([#292](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/292), thanks @digger-yu). Runtime status polling now degrades instead of crashing ([#322](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/322)); MCP OAuth cache keys are sanitized ([#313](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/313)); OpenAI defaults and Robinhood `agent.json` validation were tightened ([#319](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/319), [#320](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/320), thanks @mvanhorn); and file tools got isolated read/write roots plus broader sandbox tests ([#299](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/299), thanks @skloxo).
- **2026-06-27** 🧯 **Content-filter resilience + Shadow Account feature contract cleanup**: event-driven and swarm runs now skip individual LLM content-moderation hits, warn in run cards when filter rates are high, and recognize Gemini safety finish reasons instead of aborting an entire analysis ([#308](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/308), closes [#307](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/307), thanks @shadowinlife). Shadow Account extraction/codegen now share one `PRICE_FEATURES` contract and keep four-decimal return bounds, preventing rule/codegen drift and precision loss on `prior_5d_return` ([#316](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/316), thanks @Robin1987China).
- **2026-06-26** 🎯 **Shadow Account conditional entry + tushare ETF/index/HK routing**: extracted Shadow Account rules now carry RSI / prior-return bounds, so the generated SignalEngine enters on real conditions (RSI in range, prior-return in range) instead of blindly replaying the holding cadence ([#314](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/314), follows [#302](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/302), thanks @Robin1987China). The tushare loader also routes ETF/LOF → `fund_daily()`, indices → `index_daily()`, and HK equities → `hk_daily()` instead of always calling `daily()` (which silently returns empty for non-stocks), with per-symbol empty-result + partial-fetch warnings ([#315](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/315), closes [#310](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/310), thanks @shadowinlife).
- **2026-06-25** 🧪 **Strict validation JSON + calmer agent context**: standalone backtest validation now normalizes nested `NaN` / `Infinity` values before writing `artifacts/validation.json` or CLI stdout, so strict JSON parsers no longer choke on validation payloads ([#306](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/306), thanks @gyx09212214-prog). The agent prompt also derives the current data-source count from the loader registry, and `_microcompact()` now waits for real token pressure instead of clearing older tool results during short runs ([#296](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/296), closes [#282](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/282), thanks @MarkfuGod).
- **2026-06-24** 🎯 **Shadow Account price context + reactive Chinese UI + LAN auth fix**: Shadow Account rule extraction now sees PIT-safe entry context — `entry_rsi14` and `prior_5d_return` fetched through the loader registry as of `buy_dt`, with graceful offline/no-data degradation ([#302](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/302), follows [#295](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/295), thanks @Robin1987China). The main Web UI panels now use reactive English / zh-CN translations across charts, chat, Alpha Library, Correlation, and Run Detail ([#301](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/301), thanks @skloxo). Remote same-origin Web UI deployments with `API_AUTH_KEY` can post and upload again after the CSRF hardening, while mismatched cross-site origins remain blocked ([#304](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/304), thanks @Hinotoi-agent).
- **2026-06-23** 🛡️ **Local API CSRF hardening**: a malicious web page can no longer drive unsafe cross-site requests (POST/PUT/DELETE) against the loopback API — CORS blocks reading the response but not the side effect, so loopback dev-mode trust now applies the existing cross-site guard to unsafe methods *before* honoring it. Safe methods and local CLI / non-browser uploads are unaffected ([#293](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/293), thanks @Hinotoi-agent).
- **2026-06-22** 🔧 **Live-authorize OAuth fix + Alpha Zoo headline fix**: `connector authorize` now holds the OAuth handshake open through a multi-minute broker sign-in (tunable via `VIBE_LIVE_AUTHORIZE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) and no longer spawns a competing callback server on retry, so the token actually persists ([#281](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/281), closes [#259](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/259), thanks @Robin1987China). The Alpha Zoo page no longer prints its alpha count twice ([#287](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/287), closes [#286](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/286), thanks @digger-yu). Scheduled research also picked up end-to-end usage docs ([#288](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/288)).
- **2026-06-21** ⏰ **Scheduled-research executor + Reports library + post-backtest attribution**: scheduled research now runs **end to end** — a default-off background executor (`VIBE_TRADING_ENABLE_SCHEDULER`) fires due interval/cron jobs through the session runtime ([#278](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/278), thanks @mvanhorn, closing [#254](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/254)). A new **`/reports` Run Library** page lists, searches, and filters report-worthy runs with links into Run Detail + Compare ([#224](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/224), thanks @LemonCANDY42). And after every backtest the agent now runs **layered attribution** — trade-level winners/losers, beta regression, market-regime analysis, and a Monte Carlo permutation test, gated by data availability and routing ([#280](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/280), thanks @shadowinlife).
- **2026-06-20** 🔬 **Research Autopilot loop closes (Phase 3) + loader OHLC integrity guard + 4 academic alphas**: **Research Autopilot** now runs **hypothesis → signal-engine → backtest** end to end — `scaffold_signal_engine` writes a contract-correct engine and `link_autopilot_backtest` feeds run metrics back to the hypothesis (**68 tools**) ([#267](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/267)). A structural **OHLC sanity check** drops dirty bars (`high < low`, non-positive prices, bad bracketing) centrally at the loader boundary, guarding every data source ([#274](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/274), thanks @Shizoqua). And the **academic alpha family grows 6 → 10** — Jegadeesh reversal, George-Hwang 52-week-high, Amihud illiquidity, Harvey-Siddique skew (**456 factors**) ([#277](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/277), thanks @Robin1987China).
- **2026-06-19** 🚀 **v0.1.10 — Global data layer**: market-data sources grow 10 → 18 (free **Eastmoney / Sina / Stooq / Yahoo** + key-gated **Finnhub / Alpha Vantage / Tiingo / FMP**, ban-risk fallback) plus **18 read-only data tools** (fund flow, dragon-tiger, northbound, margin, block trades, SEC EDGAR + XBRL, financials, options chains, full-market screening…) across A-share / US / HK, all over MCP. Also bundles everything since 0.1.9 — 10 broker connectors, `alpha compare`, the provider-reliability overhaul, and the opt-in data cache. `pip install -U vibe-trading-ai`
- **2026-06-18** 🔬 **Research Autopilot Phase 1 + a local Data Bridge loader, + a Discord security notice**: new `run_research_autopilot` + `generate_backtest_config` wire **Hypothesis → Research Goal → backtest** end to end (now **50 tools**), and a **`local`** loader reads OHLCV straight from your own **CSV / Parquet / DuckDB** files ([#260](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/260), [#252](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/252), thanks @Robin1987China), alongside DeepSeek `DSML` tool-call parsing and an identifier-containment hardening wave. ⚠️ **Security:** the old community Discord invite now points to a server we don't control running a fake Collab.Land wallet-"verification" phishing scam — removed everywhere; the **only** official Discord is the HKUDS server ([discord.gg/6TdQnT5xcF](https://discord.gg/6TdQnT5xcF)), and we'll never ask you to connect a wallet.
- **2026-06-17** 🧩 **Install compatibility + Opus/Kimi provider fixes**: Baseline `pip install vibe-trading-ai` no longer pulls the optional `pyharmonics` / `ta` dependency chain; harmonic detection now lives behind `vibe-trading-ai[harmonic]` while the bundled detector remains available ([#250](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/250), closes [#249](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/249)). The agent loop also avoids assistant-prefill handoff messages rejected by Opus 4.8+, and Kimi/Moonshot can override the client `User-Agent` with `MOONSHOT_USER_AGENT` ([#248](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/248), closes [#246](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/246) and [#204](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/204)); follow-up tests now directly cover background-result and auto-compact handoff paths ([#251](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/251)).
- **2026-06-16** 🛡️ **Security/API hardening + GLM/Zhipu alias**: Settings writes require auth when configured ([#245](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/245)); API shell-capable tools require explicit `VIBE_TRADING_ENABLE_SHELL_TOOLS=1` opt-in ([#243](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/243)); local shutdown requires auth when an API key is configured ([#241](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/241)); and untrusted loopback-looking hosts are rejected instead of treated as local ([#242](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/242)). Runtime edges also got cleaned up: Web chat syncs completed attempts ([#236](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/236)), run cards emit strict JSON for non-finite metrics ([#238](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/238)), malformed `RSSHUB_TIMEOUT_S` / `RSSHUB_FETCH_BUDGET_S` falls back safely ([#240](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/240)), and ddgs retry fallback is regression-covered ([#239](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/239)). GLM/Zhipu is now a first-class provider alias with model-name inference ([#247](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/247), closes [#237](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/237)).

- **2026-06-15** 🧭 **Web-search resilience + Web UI run-continuity fixes**: `web_search` no longer fails when a single engine is rate-limited — it now queries several free, no-key engines in order (DuckDuckGo, Google, Bing, Brave, Mojeek, Yahoo) with retry/backoff, treats "no results" as an empty answer rather than an error, and returns an actionable message instead of a bare ❌ when every engine is throttled (override the engine list with `VIBE_TRADING_SEARCH_BACKENDS`) ([#232](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/232), closes [#231](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/231), thanks @Ethan-sun01). In the Web UI, switching pages during a run no longer freezes it — the chat re-subscribes to the live stream and replays missed progress on return ([#234](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/234)) — and the Stop button now takes effect mid-stream and between tools instead of only at iteration boundaries ([#235](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/235)), closing both halves of [#229](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/229) (thanks @kalkinj). The baostock loader also accepts native `sh.601398` / `sz.000001` codes alongside tushare-style `601398.SH` ([#230](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/230), thanks @bhlt).

- **2026-06-14** 📊 **Per-run token usage + progressive Run Detail charts**: Every agent run now persists provider-reported token usage as a run-scoped `llm_usage.json` — provider/model, aggregate totals, and per-iteration counts — surfaced additively on `/runs/{id}`, so a finished run's token cost stays auditable after the live stream is gone (provider-reported only; no prompt/content capture, no price estimation) ([#223](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/223), thanks @LemonCANDY42). The Run Detail page no longer loads every symbol's candlesticks up front: the default `/runs/{id}` response is unchanged, but the UI now renders the run summary first and loads each symbol's chart on demand through opt-in `?chart_payload=summary` / `?chart_symbol=` modes, with per-symbol loading state and a load-all-with-progress control ([#225](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/225), thanks @LemonCANDY42). Two loader fixes close the cycle: yfinance's exclusive `end` boundary no longer drops the final requested trading day — the download now passes `end + 1 day` while cache keys keep the original range ([#226](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/226), thanks @gyx09212214-prog) — and a malformed `CCXT_TIMEOUT_MS` / `OKX_TIMEOUT_S` value now warns and falls back to its default instead of raising at import and blocking startup ([#227](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/227), thanks @gyx09212214-prog).
- **2026-06-13** ↩️ **Resume a past session by ID from the CLI**: The interactive CLI now prints the session-id on exit, with a copy-paste `vibe-trading resume <session-id>` hint — so locating the trace for a finished run no longer means guessing which folder under `agent/sessions/` is newest by timestamp. The new `vibe-trading resume <session-id>` subcommand reopens that exact session and replays its recent turns into the loop; an unknown id fails fast instead of silently starting a blank session ([#218](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/218), thanks @zwrong).
- **2026-06-12** 🩺 **Provider reliability overhaul — DeepSeek hangs, Kimi access, streaming liveness**: A cluster of provider reports — DeepSeek runs stuck on "Agent is working…" ([#208](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/208), thanks @XYWOX), `reached max iterations` masking empty model responses ([#203](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/203), thanks @mojianliang), the UI never recovering after a stall ([#195](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/195), thanks @mafia23), and Kimi rejecting the client ([#204](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/204), thanks @liao497) — shared one root: every OpenAI-compatible provider ran through a single shim that applied DeepSeek/Kimi/Gemini quirks globally and silently swallowed stream failures. Provider-specific behavior now lives in an explicit **capability layer** — reasoning capture/replay, Gemini thought signatures, the Kimi `User-Agent`, OpenRouter's reasoning body are each gated to their own provider instead of cross-contaminating. Reasoning-only streams show a live **"Reasoning…"** indicator instead of dead air; a stream failure raises a contextual `provider_stream_error` with one automatic retry for transient resets (deterministic 4xx fail fast) instead of silently falling back to a slow non-streaming call; an empty model response is reported as `empty_model_response` instead of "max iterations"; SSE heartbeats no longer break reconnect replay; and a stuck read-only tool times out instead of hiding behind heartbeats forever. A new **`vibe-trading provider doctor`** prints a redacted provider/model/package/proxy snapshot for one-command triage of environment-side hangs. DeepSeek users can opt into the official native adapter with `pip install "vibe-trading-ai[deepseek]"`, and kimi-k2.x's `temperature=1` requirement is applied automatically — the Kimi path is verified end-to-end against the live API (tool calls + strict multi-turn reasoning replay on `kimi-k2.6`).

- **2026-06-11** 🐝 **Swarm workers now pull market data through the loader layer**: An investment-committee run on NVDA exposed a chain of gaps — workers wrote ad-hoc yfinance scripts, trusted a malformed latest bar (volume present, OHLC empty), leaked `NaN` into non-strict JSON, and a context-free continuation prompt re-routed to the wrong preset ([#198](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/198), thanks @BillDin for an exceptional diagnosis plus both fixes). Swarm workers now get a local `get_market_data` tool backed by the same normalized loader registry as MCP — strict JSON, non-finite floats serialize as `null` — wired into **every market-data preset** (21 workers across 13 presets) with a prompt policy that steers OHLCV work tool-first ([#199](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/199)); `run_swarm` takes an explicit `preset_name` and refuses ambiguous continuation fragments instead of silently falling back to `equity_research_team` ([#200](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/200)). Grounding got smarter too: a bare US ticker like `NVDA` in a swarm prompt is promoted to `NVDA.US` (stopword-guarded), so workers start from authoritative pre-fetched prices. The tool joins the main agent registry as well — **48 tools** now. Also: **your Docker data now survives updates** — persistent memory, the session search index, user-created skills, shadow accounts and broker config live in named volumes, so `docker compose up --build` no longer wipes them ([#197](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/197), thanks @FlyerJ).
- **2026-06-10** 🐳 **Docker reaches a host-side Ollama out of the box**: Inside the container `localhost` is the container itself, so the shipped `OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434` failed the LLM preflight for every Dockerized Ollama setup. `docker-compose.yml` now defaults to `http://host.docker.internal:11434` (export `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to point elsewhere) and adds the `host-gateway` `extra_hosts` mapping so the same file works on Linux as well as Docker Desktop ([#196](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/196), thanks @ShahNewazKhan).
- **2026-06-09** 🔑 **Clearer error when the Web UI is opened from another machine**: Reaching the chat from a non-loopback client (another machine, a VM host, a phone on your LAN) without `API_AUTH_KEY` set returned `403` on every sensitive endpoint — sending a message, listing sessions, live status — but the chat only showed a generic "Failed to send message, please retry." The send path now surfaces the real reason — *"Remote API access requires an API key. Add it in Settings, or run the backend on localhost for local-only use."* — and the README's web-UI setup spells out the localhost-vs-LAN rule plus the three fixes (browse via `localhost` on the same machine; set `API_AUTH_KEY` and enter it once in Settings; or `VIBE_TRADING_TRUST_DOCKER_LOOPBACK=1` for Docker Desktop's host gateway) ([#191](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/191), thanks @mafia23).
- **2026-06-08** 🔧 **Gemini 3.x multi-turn tool-calling fix**: This completes the Gemini 3.x thinking-model fix. The 6/05 round-trip ([#176](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/176)) only covered in-memory history, but the real agent loop replays history as OpenAI-format dicts where LangChain dropped the per-tool-call `thought_signature` before the request was built — so multi-turn tool calling still 400'd with `missing thought_signature`. It is now re-attached at the single `_convert_input` chokepoint both `invoke` and `stream` pass through (parallel calls, where only the first of N is signed, included) ([#184](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/184), thanks @ngoanpv).
- **2026-06-07** 🐝 **Live swarm status in the chat timeline**: When the agent launches a multi-agent swarm (investment committee, quant desk, risk committee, …), the chat now renders an inline **status card** that streams each worker's state — waiting / running / done / failed / blocked / retrying — in real time, the same per-agent visibility the standalone swarm dashboard already had. Runtime events are bridged into the session SSE stream without changing the existing `/swarm/runs` API, and a finished card rehydrates from the final `run_swarm` result on reconnect or history replay ([#188](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/188), thanks @BillDin). Preset routing also got sharper: an explicitly named preset (e.g. `investment_committee`, with or without underscores) now wins over keyword scoring, and the bare `IV` derivatives keyword no longer false-matches inside ordinary words like "g**iv**en" ([#189](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/189), thanks @BillDin).
- **2026-06-06** ⚖️ **Alpha compare — head-to-head across CLI, Web UI, REST & agent**: A new `alpha compare` benches a hand-picked shortlist of Alpha Zoo alphas against each other on a universe and period, then ranks them by IC mean/std, IR, IC-positive ratio or sample count — each with its gap to the leader. Unlike a full-zoo bench it evaluates **only the alphas you name** (a new `run_bench(only=…)` subset filter), so comparing three alphas no longer scores all 191 in their zoo. One shared core powers every surface: `vibe-trading alpha compare <id1> <id2> … --sort ir` (CLI), a **Compare view** in the Alpha Zoo Web UI (tick alphas in the catalogue → one-click compare with a streamed ranking table), `POST /alpha/compare` + SSE (REST), and a read-only `alpha_compare` agent tool (**47 tools** now).
- **2026-06-05** 🇮🇳 **Dhan + Shoonya connectors (India) — 10 brokers total**: The connector-first trading layer adds **Dhan** and **Shoonya** for the Indian market (NSE/BSE equities + F&O), bringing the roster to ten brokers. Both are **paper + read-only** — like Longbridge, their APIs expose no runtime paper/live discriminator, so their `place_order` / `cancel_order` hard-refuse any non-paper config at the first line (the rule: a broker with no structural paper/live guard is capped at paper + read-only) ([#181](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/181), closes [#174](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/174)). This cycle also fixes **Gemini 2.5 / 3.x thinking models**: their per-tool-call `thoughtSignature` now round-trips through the OpenAI-compatible path, so multi-turn function calling no longer fails with `INVALID_ARGUMENT` ([#176](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/176), closes [#170](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/170), thanks @mvanhorn & @jliu6789). Chinese docstrings landed on all **452 Alpha Zoo factors** ([#180](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/180), thanks @LeeCQiang), and a **frontend test suite (197 vitest tests)** plus backend auth / path-traversal / CORS security tests joined CI ([#175](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/175), thanks @sambazhu).
- **2026-06-04** 🗃️ **Opt-in local data cache for all 7 data sources**: A new `VIBE_TRADING_DATA_CACHE` switch lets every backtest loader — tushare, okx, ccxt, akshare, mootdx, yfinance, futu — cache settled historical bars under `~/.vibe-trading/cache` (user home, never the repo), so repeated and long-horizon / cross-market backtests skip the network and avoid provider rate limits. Off by default. Batch and connection loaders (yfinance, futu) skip the bulk download / FutuOpenD connection entirely on a full cache hit, a staleness guard never caches a range ending today (its last bar is still forming), and cached frames round-trip byte-identical to freshly fetched ones ([#177](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/177), thanks @mvanhorn). A new contributor guide for AI / automation-assisted PRs also landed, mapping safe local checks and high-risk broker/MCP/credential surfaces ([#173](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/173)).
- **2026-06-03** 🧹 **Community triage + trace correlation**: Tool-call trace entries now carry the originating `call_id`, so a `tool_result` can be matched back to its `tool_call` when replaying a run trace — arg previews stay truncated to keep trace files small ([#168](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/168), thanks @zwrong). Source comments no longer point at an internal-only docs path that external contributors couldn't find ([#166](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/166), thanks @jaleelpersonal). Also clarified that the `langchain-community` resolver warning on install is a harmless leftover-package notice, not a failure ([#167](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/167)), and scoped Gemini 2.5/3.0 `thoughtSignature` round-tripping for function calls as a `help wanted` task with a full fix plan ([#170](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/170), thanks @jliu6789).
- **2026-06-02** 🔌 **Six new broker connectors (Tiger / Longbridge / Alpaca / OKX / Binance / Futu)**: The connector-first trading layer gains a direct-SDK transport alongside IBKR (local) and Robinhood (MCP). Each connector exposes read-only account / positions / orders / quote / history **plus paper-account order placement** — test your strategies across these broker paper accounts. Five of them (Tiger, Alpaca, OKX, Binance, Futu) also support **bounded, mandate-gated order placement** behind the same safety model as Robinhood: a user-committed mandate (symbol universe / order size / exposure / leverage / daily cap), a filesystem kill switch, a fail-closed pre-trade gate, and a full audit ledger. **Longbridge is paper + read-only only** (its API exposes no runtime paper/live discriminator). Every paper/live distinction is a structural per-broker guard — account-id format, host separation, demo flag, or trade environment. New `trading_place_order` / `trading_cancel_order` tools; HK and A-share asset classes added to the mandate universe. Experimental / use at your own risk.
- **2026-06-01** 🚀 **v0.1.9 released** (`pip install -U vibe-trading-ai`): Rolls up everything since 0.1.8. Connector-first broker profiles (IBKR local read-only TWS / IB Gateway + Robinhood Agentic Trading behind OAuth, a committed mandate, order guard, audit ledger, and instant halt). Research Goal runtime across CLI / REST / MCP / Web. A swarm pass — live reconcile + MCP keepalive, operator-configured worker MCP tools, a strict alpha-bench random control, and a new `retry_run` to relaunch failed/stale runs (**36 MCP tools** now). The `agent/cli/` package refactor with a refreshed terminal UI, the `mootdx` no-token A-share loader, and a robustness pass across backtest / agent loop / sessions. `--version` now always matches the installed package, fixing the 0.1.8 drift ([#156](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/156)).
- **2026-05-31** 🔌 **Connector-first broker architecture (IBKR + Robinhood)**: Trading access now starts from a selectable connector profile instead of separate broker/live entry points. `vibe-trading connector list/use/check/account/positions/orders/quote/history` and the MCP `trading_*` tools share the same selected profile, where paper/live is an attribute of the connector. IBKR can be used immediately through a local read-only TWS / IB Gateway profile, while the official IBKR remote MCP path is seeded as an OAuth `mcp.read` probe until stable read tool names are available. Robinhood Agentic Trading remains the bounded live MCP connector behind OAuth, a committed mandate, order guard, audit ledger, and instant halt.
- **2026-05-30** 🧰 **Robustness pass — backtest, agent loop, sessions**: LLM-generated signal engines now pass pre-flight interface validation before instantiation, catching circular self-imports, a missing `generate()`, non-defaulted `__init__` args, and wrong return types with actionable JSON errors instead of raw tracebacks ([#149](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/149)); a follow-up routes source-level AST validation errors through the same clean JSON envelope. The agent loop no longer burns all 50 iterations into a `failed` status with no output — it mirrors the swarm worker's wrap-up nudge at 80% of the iteration budget and drops tool definitions on the last iteration to force a final text answer ([#148](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/148)), guarded to fire only mid-run so it never displaces research-goal context. Session message writes now `flush + fsync` each append so expensive AI responses survive a mid-write crash, and the read path skips corrupted JSONL lines (logging the first 200 chars for recovery) instead of 500-ing the whole `/messages` endpoint ([#147](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/147)). The Web composer also fixes IME Enter handling so a composition-confirming Enter no longer submits mid-word ([#146](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/146)).
- **2026-05-29** 🔐 **Robinhood Agentic Trading support (opt-in, bounded autonomy)**: Adds support for Robinhood Agentic Trading (remote MCP, OAuth). Off and read-only by default; the agent acts only inside a user-committed mandate (symbols / order size / exposure / leverage / daily cap), with a filesystem-level instant kill switch, preemptive flatten, mandate auto-expiry, a full audit ledger, and a persistent autonomous runner. No custody, no venue — the broker holds funds and executes; we only relay intent. Experimental / use at your own risk.
- **2026-05-28** 🧪 **Swarm safety + strict alpha gate + worker MCP**: Swarm DAG blocks downstream tasks when upstream fails ([#145](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/145)). New `run_bench_strict()` adds a same-universe random control + OOS split to catch factors that just track market beta ([#143](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/143), thanks @Soli22de). Swarm workers can call operator-configured external MCP servers, with trust boundary pinned ([#142](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/142), thanks @shadowinlife).
- **2026-05-27** 📊 **mootdx A-share data source + output polish**: New `mootdx` loader speaks the native 通达信 TCP protocol for A-share OHLCV (no auth, no IP rate-limit, daily + intraday with 25-page walk-back pagination), slotting between tushare and akshare in the fallback chain ([#107](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/107)). CCXT loader now reads `HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/ALL_PROXY` so Binance/OKX public data works from restricted networks ([#126](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/126), thanks @ruok808). Final-answer rendering also dropped the ugly full-width `---` horizontal separators on CLI and Web: the system prompt now nudges the agent toward markdown tables and `##` headings, the CLI renderer strips standalone HRs as defense-in-depth, and the chat bubble hides any `<hr>` that slips through ([#139](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/139), thanks @sdwxm188).
- **2026-05-26** ✅ **Research Goal lifecycle closure**: Goal mode now behaves like a real task runner: Web UI goal creation creates or binds the session and immediately sends the kickoff turn; active goals can be continued, edited, cancelled, and completed across Web/API/CLI/MCP; and the agent advances from the current goal snapshot (criteria, evidence, claims, open items) instead of only the original prompt. Covered-but-still-active goals now enter an audit/status update instead of stopping silently, with regression coverage across backend, CLI, MCP, and frontend events.

- **2026-05-25** 🧼 **Cleaner chat UI + composer workflow**: The Web UI keeps chat focused on the next action: upload, swarm, and research-goal modes now live behind the composer `+` menu instead of floating panels. Active context appears above the input as compact chips, and goal details expand inline only when needed. The UI also drops the old custom i18n layer in favor of direct English copy, gates Full Report cards to report-worthy runs, and hardens local dev startup/status reporting for reliable browser smoke tests.
- **2026-05-24** 🎯 **Research Goal runtime**: Added a session-scoped Research Goal layer across backend, CLI, API/MCP, SSE, and Web UI. Goals persist claims, acceptance criteria, evidence rows, budgets, and completion policy; agent tools can create goals and attach evidence; `/goal` gives the CLI a direct entry point; REST/MCP expose goal snapshots and evidence writes; SSE keeps chat clients fresh. Follow-up audit fixes locked down verified evidence, blocked live-trading risk tiers through agent tools, wired CLI-created goals into later turns, cleaned goal ledgers on session deletion, enabled replay-all, and fixed cross-session frontend races.
- **2026-05-23** 🖥️ **Interactive CLI refresh**: The terminal front door now opens with a larger Vibe-Trading banner, a cleaner prompt divider, prior-turn recap, post-run timing, and a Claude Code-style activity rail for live agent work. Tool calls, web/data fetches, shell-style actions, Markdown answers, and pipe tables render in a more readable transcript, while piped or non-TTY runs keep plain-text output for automation. Generated CLI screenshots are now treated as local artifacts instead of committed docs files, keeping the repository lighter.
- **2026-05-22** 🧭 **Swarm recovery + MCP keepalive**: Swarm status now reconciles from live task files on every read, so API/MCP/SSE/list views recover crashed or stale runs instead of showing permanent `running` snapshots. `run_swarm` sends MCP progress heartbeats while it polls, with a fixed first frame of `swarm_started run_id=<id>` for clients that reconnect after transport drops; workers now heartbeat through LLM streaming, grounding fetches, and tool execution. The stale-run reaper uses per-run thresholds and derives terminal status from task states, `SwarmTool` no longer cancels a still-running team just because its wait budget elapsed, and MCP clients can call `reap_stale_runs()` for explicit cleanup. Today's DX pass also refreshed provider default models and aligned CI syntax checks with the new `agent/cli/` package. 22 new regressions cover hydration, terminal recovery, stale reaping, keepalive cadence, env parsing, and heartbeat wiring; the full swarm/MCP suite is at 169 passed, 4 skipped.
- **2026-05-21** 🧱 **CLI package refactor**: `agent/cli.py` (3216 LOC) split into the `agent/cli/` package — interactive front door, slash router, Rich components, plus a `_legacy.py` shim that preserves every subcommand and re-exports every public symbol so `cli.cmd_*` / `cli._INIT_ENV_PATH` / `cli.Confirm` keep working. New FastAPI middleware serves the SPA shell when a browser opens `/runs/{id}` or `/correlation` directly; same narrowing landed in the Vite dev proxy. Version unified via `cli/_version.py` (no more drift between `--version` and the banner), `python -m cli` restored via `__main__.py`, and the chat-gate narrowed so `chat --help` / `chat extra` reach legacy argparse instead of being swallowed by the REPL.
- **2026-05-20** 🔬 **Hypothesis Registry CLI**: Closes the CLI side of the Hypothesis Registry shipped backend-only on 2026-05-16. `vibe-trading hypothesis list` prints a Rich table or JSON (`--status` filter, `--limit`); `show <id>` renders a detail panel including linked run cards; `invalidate <id> --note "..."` flips status to `rejected` while preserving prior invalidation notes when `--note` is omitted. Honors the existing `VIBE_TRADING_HYPOTHESES_PATH` env override and adds a per-invocation `--path`. 22 new tests cover wiring, JSON output, status filter, limit, missing-id errors, and note persistence.
- **2026-05-19** ✨ **Live tool feedback + graceful cancel**: Long-running tools (backtests, large PDFs, swarm workers) no longer look frozen. Each tool call now emits a 3-second heartbeat plus structured per-stage progress — `run_backtest` shows phase markers (`validate` / `simulate` / `finalize`), `read_document` ticks per page on PDF or per sheet on Excel, `read_url` marks `fetch` / `parse`. The CLI Rich Live dashboard renders a Unicode spinner, ASCII progress bar, ETA, and stacks up to 3 parallel tools keyed by name; the frontend chat ships a new `ToolProgressIndicator` with rAF-coalesced renders, ARIA `role="status"` + hidden native `<progress>` for screen readers, and a determinate `ProgressRing` SVG when total is known. First `Ctrl+C` during a CLI run now calls `agent.cancel()` for graceful exit (current step finishes, trace closes cleanly); a second within 2s force-quits. Reusable primitives extracted along the way: `ProgressBar.tsx` and `lib/tools.ts` (shared tool-name i18n).
- **2026-05-18** 🧹 **Cleanup pass + three latent bug fixes**: `CompositeEngine` no longer misroutes bare Chinese-futures codes like `RB2410` to `GlobalFuturesEngine` — `_is_china_futures` moved into a shared `_market_hooks` module with a case-normalized product table and a non-CN exchange guard, plus 9 new regression cases. Session FTS5 indexes now persist timestamps so cross-session search can sort by date; the same path also fixed a re-upsert that was wall-clocking every session's `started_at`. The Vite dev-mode proxy gained the missing `/alpha` entry so the AlphaZoo page resolves on `npm run dev`. `tests/test_e2e_harness_v2.py` (real-LLM e2e suite) is now gated behind `VIBE_TRADING_RUN_LIVE_E2E=1` so CI no longer changes shape based on env-key presence. Ruff `per-file-ignores` added for the factor zoo (3783 → 0 F401 noise), frontend tsconfig enables `noUnusedLocals` / `noUnusedParameters` as regression guards, and 76 unused `vw = vwap(...)` boilerplate lines were dropped from `gtja191` alphas. Net **-918 LOC**.
- **2026-05-17** 🧬 **Alpha Zoo v1 (0.1.8)**: 452 pre-built quant alphas across 4 zoos — `qlib158` (Microsoft Qlib, Apache-2 attribution), `alpha101` (Kakushadze 101 Formulaic Alphas, paper rewrite from arXiv:1601.00991), `gtja191` (Guotai Junan 2014 short-horizon factor report), and `academic` (Fama-French 5 + Carhart price-based proxies). One-line CLI to bench any zoo on your universe: `vibe-trading alpha bench --zoo gtja191 --universe csi300 --period 2018-2025`. Ships with AST purity gate, lookahead-guard test, `pytest-socket` network kill-switch, per-zoo LICENSE.md, and a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) workflow for community PRs. Auto-rendered Alpha Library at [vibetrading.wiki/alpha-library/](https://vibetrading.wiki/alpha-library/) + research-lab post [Which of the 191 GTJA alphas still work in 2026?](https://vibetrading.wiki/research-lab/posts/alpha-191-in-2026.html).
- **2026-05-16** 🧪 **Research spine update**: Added a backend Hypothesis Registry with `create_hypothesis`, `update_hypothesis`, `link_backtest`, and `search_hypotheses`; external-content readers now attach warning-only `security_warnings`; and Shadow Account scanning now uses deterministic OHLCV feature evaluation instead of the old calendar-phase stub.
- **2026-05-15** 🪪 The run detail page now surfaces the Trust Layer run card alongside metrics and artifacts, completing the UI side of the `run_card.json` work landed on 2026-05-12. `PersistentMemory.add()` was also hardened on length, empty/whitespace-only names, and C0/C1 control bytes from the #108/#109/#110 triage ([#112](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/112), thanks @Teerapat-Vatpitak).
- **2026-05-14** 🌐 the public wiki is now live at [vibetrading.wiki](https://vibetrading.wiki/) with docs, tutorials, Research Lab, and Alpha Library sections deployed through Cloudflare Pages. Persistent memory is also inspectable from the CLI via `vibe-trading memory list/show/search/forget` ([#102](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/102), thanks @Teerapat-Vatpitak), and memory tokenization/slugs now support Thai, Arabic, Hebrew, and Cyrillic text ([#104](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/104)).
- **2026-05-13** 🧭 Swarm runs now ground workers with fetched market data and cleaner persisted reports ([#93](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/93), [#84](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/84)).
- **2026-05-12** 🧾 Backtests now emit `run_card.json` and `run_card.md` alongside artifacts for reproducible research runs.
- **2026-05-11** 🧭 **Memory slugs, swarm accounting, and CLI preflight**: Persistent memory now preserves CJK characters when generating file slugs, preventing silent filename collisions for Chinese/Japanese/Korean notes ([#95](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/95), thanks @voidborne-d). Swarm run totals now prefer provider-reported token usage with the existing estimate fallback ([#94](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/94), thanks @Teerapat-Vatpitak), and the CLI run UI gained a startup preflight check for common environment issues ([#96](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/96), thanks @ykykj).
- **2026-05-10** 🧱 **Regression guardrails + run metadata**: Memory recall now treats underscores as token boundaries, so snake_case saved memories such as `mcp_wiring_test` match natural-language queries like "mcp wiring" ([#87](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/87), thanks @hp083625). The MCP server has a subprocess smoke test covering initialize → `tools/list` → `tools/call` to guard the first-call deadlock path ([#86](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/86)), while low-risk hardening landed for Windows path-sensitive tests, API best-effort exception handling, backtest `run_dir` allowed-root validation, and SwarmRun provider/model metadata ([#88](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/88), [#90](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/90), [#91](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/91), [#92](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/92), thanks @Teerapat-Vatpitak).
- **2026-05-09** 🛡️ **API path hardening + MCP server stability**: API run/session routes now validate path IDs before lookup, rejecting malformed newline-containing parameters and pinning the behavior in the auth/security regression suite ([#80](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/80), thanks @SJoon99). The MCP server now pre-warms the tool registry on the main thread before serving `tools/call`, avoiding a first-call deadlock in lazy tool discovery ([#85](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/85), thanks @Teerapat-Vatpitak). The Vite dev proxy also honors `VITE_API_URL` for non-default backend targets ([#82](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/82), thanks @voidborne-d).
- **2026-05-08** 🧾 **Tushare statement fields in filters**: A-share daily backtests can now request PIT-safe financial statement fields through `fundamental_fields`, so signal engines can screen on `income_total_revenue`, `income_n_income`, `balancesheet_total_hldr_eqy_exc_min_int`, `fina_indicator_roe`, and similar table-prefixed columns after their announcement/disclosure dates ([#76](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/76), thanks @mrbob-git). Follow-up hardening makes explicit statement-field requests fail fast if Tushare enrichment cannot run, instead of silently falling back to raw price bars ([#77](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/77)).
- **2026-05-07** 📈 **Tushare fundamentals + community triage**: Added a point-in-time `TushareFundamentalProvider` contract for fundamental research workflows, with regression coverage for the project `TUSHARE_TOKEN` environment path ([#74](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/74)). Community triage also clarified that Vibe-Trading keeps rapid iteration focused on one UI language for now, avoids adding redundant search dependencies while DuckDuckGo-backed `web_search` is already bundled, and treats unofficial hosted deployments as untrusted places for API keys or data-source tokens.
- **2026-05-06** 🚀 **v0.1.7 released** ([Release notes](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/releases/tag/v0.1.7), `pip install -U vibe-trading-ai`): Security-boundary hardening is now published on PyPI and ClawHub, covering safer API/read/upload/file/URL/generated-code/shell-tool/Docker defaults while keeping localhost CLI/Web UI workflows low-friction. This cycle also includes Web UI Settings, correlation heatmap, OpenAI Codex OAuth, A-share pre-ST filtering, interactive CLI UX, swarm preset inspection, dividend analysis, dev workflow polish, and audited frontend build-dependency floors. Thanks to the 0.1.7 contributors and to lemi9090 (S2W) for coordinated security validation.
- **2026-05-05** 🛡️ **Security boundary follow-up**: Completes the remaining security-boundary hardening around explicit CORS origins, Settings credential indicators, web URL reading, and Shadow Account code generation, with regression tests added for each path. Normal localhost CLI/Web UI workflows stay the same; remote deployments should continue using `API_AUTH_KEY` and explicit trusted origins.
- **2026-05-04** 🖥️ **Interactive CLI UX + CI cleanup**: Interactive mode now has a live bottom status bar showing provider/model, session duration, last-run latency, and cumulative tool-call stats, plus prompt history navigation and cursor editing with arrow keys via `prompt_toolkit` ([#69](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/69)). The CLI still falls back to Rich prompts when `prompt_toolkit` or a TTY is unavailable. CI path expectations were also aligned with the hardened file-import sandbox and cross-platform `/tmp` resolution, returning main to green ([`bb67dc7`](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/commit/bb67dc7cfcc11553c57d8962bee56381dca43758)).
- **2026-05-03** 🛡️ **Security hardening patch**: Tightens default API authentication for non-local deployments, protects sensitive run/session/swarm reads, restricts upload and local file-reading boundaries, gates shell-capable tools by entry point, validates generated strategy loading before import, and runs the Docker image as a non-root user with a localhost-only published port by default. Local CLI and localhost Web UI workflows remain low-friction; remote API/Web deployments should set `API_AUTH_KEY`.
- **2026-05-02** 🧭 **Dividend analysis + sharper roadmap**: Added the `dividend-analysis` skill for income stocks, payout sustainability, dividend growth, shareholder yield, ex-dividend mechanics, and yield-trap checks, pinned by bundled-skill regression tests. The public roadmap now focuses on upcoming work: Research Autopilot, Data Bridge, Options Lab, Portfolio Studio, Alpha Zoo, Research Delivery, Trust Layer, and Community sharing.
- **2026-05-01** 🔥 **Correlation heatmap + OpenAI Codex OAuth + A-share pre-ST filter**: New correlation dashboard/API computes rolling return correlations and renders an ECharts heatmap for portfolio and symbol analysis ([#64](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/64)). OpenAI Codex provider support now uses ChatGPT OAuth via `vibe-trading provider login openai-codex`, with Settings metadata and adapter regression tests ([#65](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/65)). Added and hardened the `ashare-pre-st-filter` skill for A-share ST/*ST risk screening, including Sina penalty relevance filtering so securities-account mentions do not inflate E2 counts ([#63](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/63)).
- **2026-04-30** ⚙️ **Web UI Settings + validation CLI hardening**: New Settings page for LLM provider/model, base URL, reasoning effort, and data source credentials, backed by local/auth-protected settings APIs and data-driven provider metadata ([#57](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/57)). Also hardens `python -m backtest.validation <run_dir>` so missing, blank, malformed, non-existent, and non-directory inputs fail with clear operator-facing messages before validation starts ([#60](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/60)).
- **2026-04-28** 🚀 **v0.1.6 released** (`pip install -U vibe-trading-ai`): Fixes `vibe-trading --swarm-presets` returning empty after `pip install` / `uv tool install` ([#55](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/55)) — preset YAMLs now bundled inside the `src.swarm` package and pinned by a 6-test regression suite. Plus AKShare loader correctly routes ETFs (`510300.SH`) and forex (`USDCNH`) to the right endpoints with hardened registry fallback. Rolls up everything since v0.1.5: benchmark comparison panel, `/upload` streaming + size limits, Futu loader (HK + A-share), vnpy export skill, security hardening, frontend lazy loading (688KB → 262KB).
- **2026-04-27** 📊 **Benchmark panel + upload safety**: Backtest output now ships a benchmark comparison panel (ticker / benchmark return / excess return / information ratio) with yfinance-backed resolution for SPY, CSI 300, etc. ([#48](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/48)). Plus `/upload` streams the request body in 1 MB chunks and aborts past `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`, bounding memory under oversized/malformed clients ([#53](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/53)) — pinned by a 4-case regression suite.
- **2026-04-22** 🛡️ **Hardening + new integrations**: Path containment enforced in `safe_path` + journal/shadow tool sandbox, `MANIFEST.in` ships `.env.example` / tests / Docker files in sdist, route-level lazy loading shrinks frontend initial bundle 688KB → 262KB. Plus Futu data loader for HK & A-share equities ([#47](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/47)) and vnpy CtaTemplate export skill ([#46](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/46)).
- **2026-04-21** 🛡️ **Workspace + docs**: Relative `run_dir` normalized to active run dir ([#43](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/43)). README usage examples ([#45](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/45)).
- **2026-04-20** 🔌 **Reasoning + Swarm**: `reasoning_content` preserved across all `ChatOpenAI` paths — Kimi / DeepSeek / Qwen thinking work end-to-end ([#39](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/39)). Swarm streaming + clean Ctrl+C ([#42](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/42)).
- **2026-04-19** 📦 **v0.1.5**: Published to PyPI & ClawHub. `python-multipart` CVE floor bump, 5 new MCP tools wired (`analyze_trade_journal` + 4 shadow-account tools), `pattern_recognition` → `pattern` registry fix, Docker dep parity, SKILL manifest synced (22 MCP tools / 71 skills).
- **2026-04-18** 👥 **Shadow Account**: Extract your strategy rules from a broker journal → backtest the shadow across markets → 8-section HTML/PDF report showing exactly how much you leave on the table (rule violations, early exits, missed signals, counterfactual trades). 4 new tools, 1 skill, 32 tools total. Trade Journal + Shadow Account samples now live in the web UI welcome screen.
- **2026-04-17** 📊 **Trade Journal Analyzer + Universal File Reader**: Upload broker exports (同花顺/东财/富途/generic CSV) → auto trading profile (holding days, win rate, PnL ratio, drawdown) + 4 bias diagnostics (disposition effect, overtrading, chasing momentum, anchoring). `read_document` now dispatches PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, images (OCR), and 40+ text formats behind one unified call.
- **2026-04-16** 🧠 **Agent Harness**: Persistent cross-session memory, FTS5 session search, self-evolving skills (full CRUD), 5-layer context compression, read/write tool batching. 27 tools, 107 new tests.
- **2026-04-15** 🤖 **Z.ai + MiniMax**: Z.ai provider ([#35](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/35)), MiniMax temperature fix + model update ([#33](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/33)). 13 providers.
- **2026-04-14** 🔧 **MCP Stability**: Fixed backtest tool `Connection closed` error on stdio transport ([#32](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/32)).
- **2026-04-13** 🌐 **Cross-Market Composite Backtest**: New `CompositeEngine` backtests mixed-market portfolios (e.g. A-shares + crypto) with shared capital pool and per-market rules. Also fixed swarm template variable fallback and frontend timeout.
- **2026-04-12** 🌍 **Multi-Platform Export**: `/pine` exports strategies to TradingView (Pine Script v6), TDX (通达信/同花顺/东方财富), and MetaTrader 5 (MQL5) in one command.
- **2026-04-11** 🛡️ **Reliability & DX**: `vibe-trading init` .env bootstrap ([#19](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/19)), preflight checks, runtime data-source fallback, hardened backtest engine. Multi-language README ([#21](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/21)).
- **2026-04-10** 📦 **v0.1.4**: Docker fix ([#8](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/8)), `web_search` MCP tool, 12 LLM providers, `akshare`/`ccxt` deps. Published to PyPI and ClawHub.
- **2026-04-09** 📊 **Backtest Wave 2**: ChinaFutures, GlobalFutures, Forex, Options v2 engines. Monte Carlo, Bootstrap CI, Walk-Forward validation.
- **2026-04-08** 🔧 **Multi-market backtest** with per-market rules, Pine Script v6 export, 5 data sources with auto-fallback.

## 💡 What Is Vibe-Trading?

Vibe-Trading is an open-source research workspace for turning finance questions into runnable analysis. It connects natural-language prompts to market-data loaders, strategy generation, backtest engines, reports, exports, and persistent research memory.

It is designed for research, simulation, and backtesting — and, when you choose, autonomous trading through a broker you authorize yourself (e.g. Robinhood Agentic Trading). It holds no funds and never trades outside the limits you set, and you can halt it instantly.

---

## ✨ What You Can Do

| Task | Output |
|------|--------|
| **Ask a trading question** | Market research with tools, data, documents, and reusable session context. |
| **Backtest a strategy idea** | Strategy code, metrics, benchmark context, validation artifacts, and run cards. |
| **Review your own trades** | Broker-journal parsing, behavior diagnostics, rule extraction, and Shadow Account comparisons. |
| **Read documents & charts** | Parse PDF / DOCX / XLSX / PPTX / images with pluggable OCR (`read_document`), and read chart screenshots semantically with a vision model (`analyze_image`). Web chat accepts up to five files at once through the picker, drag-and-drop, or clipboard paste. |
| **Read institutional filings & fund books** | SEC 13F manager books with quarter-over-quarter position diffs, ETF constituents across markets, event-contract implied probability, and arXiv / OpenAlex factor extraction — all read-only, on free public sources. |
| **Improve repeated research** | Persistent memory and editable skills turn useful routines into reusable workflows. |
| **Run analyst teams** | Multi-agent research reviews for investment, quant, crypto, macro, and risk workflows. |
| **Put research into IM channels** | Run the same session runtime through WebSocket, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Matrix, WhatsApp, Signal, QQ/NapCat, WeChat/WeCom, Feishu/Lark, DingTalk, Teams, email, and Mochat with CLI, REST, and Web UI controls. |
| **Ship usable artifacts** | Reports, TradingView Pine Script, TDX, MetaTrader 5, MCP tools, and later research sessions. |
| **Bench a pre-built alpha zoo** | One-line IC + alive/reversed/dead categorisation across 462 alphas (Qlib 158 + Kakushadze 101 + GTJA 191 + academic + PIT-safe fundamental) on your universe. |
| **Spot correlation regimes** | An edge-density + hysteresis timeline on the `/correlation` surface showing when markets fuse into one bloc — descriptive risk context, not a signal. |

## ⚡ Quick Example

```bash
pip install vibe-trading-ai

# Natural-language research
vibe-trading run -p "Backtest a BTC-USDT 20/50 moving-average strategy for 2024, summarize return and drawdown, then export the report"

# Bench a pre-built alpha zoo (one line)
vibe-trading alpha bench --zoo gtja191 --universe csi300 --period 2018-2025 --top 20
```

```bash
vibe-trading --upload trades_export.csv
vibe-trading run -p "Analyze my trading behavior, extract my shadow strategy, and compare it with my actual trades"
```

---

## 👥 Shadow Account

Shadow Account starts from your own trading records instead of a generic strategy template.

Upload a broker export, let the agent summarize your behavior, then compare the actual trading path with a rule-based shadow strategy.

| Step | Agent output |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Read your journal** | Parses broker exports from 同花顺, 东方财富, 富途, and generic CSV formats. |
| **2. Profile your behavior** | Holding days, win rate, PnL ratio, drawdown, disposition effect, overtrading, momentum chasing, and anchoring checks. |
| **3. Extract your rules** | Turns recurring entries/exits into an explicit strategy profile instead of a hand-wavy summary. |
| **4. Run the shadow** | Backtests the extracted rules and highlights rule breaks, early exits, missed signals, and alternative trade paths. |
| **5. Deliver the report** | Produces an HTML/PDF report that can be inspected, archived, or refined in a later session. |

```bash
vibe-trading --upload trades_export.csv
vibe-trading run -p "Analyze my trading behavior, extract my shadow strategy, and compare it with my actual trades"
```

## 💼 Local Multi-Broker Portfolio

The Web UI adds a read-only **Portfolio** page that aggregates holdings across the broker connections you pick. Sources are connection instances of read-only profiles declaring `account.read` and `positions.read` — set them up under **Broker Connectors** in [Detailed Capabilities](#-detailed-capabilities). Eligibility is only the safety gate; the connection center also shows how far each connector has been verified for portfolio valuation.

| Behavior | What you get |
|----------|--------------|
| **Per-source provenance** | Every holding names the connection it came from, valued in USD with a CNY conversion. |
| **Failed sources excluded** | A source that errors is reported as an error and left out of the totals — never carried forward — and the snapshot is marked incomplete. |
| **Immutable snapshots** | Each refresh is stored in `~/.vibe-trading/portfolio/portfolio.sqlite3`; credential-free settings live in `~/.vibe-trading/portfolio.json` and `connections.json`. |
| **Export & analysis** | CSV export, plus a sanitized `portfolio_summary` agent tool whose `risk_xray_args` pass straight into `portfolio_risk_xray`. The same snapshot prints in the terminal with `vibe-trading portfolio show` (`refresh` / `sources` alongside). |

Broker-reported source currencies are preserved during valuation: HKD account totals and positions, including Futu `HK.*` holdings, are converted with the snapshot USD/HKD rate before USD and CNY values are displayed. Older snapshots remain stored, but value history compares only snapshots produced by the current valuation methodology to avoid false gains or losses after a valuation fix.

### Portfolio connector compatibility

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Native adapter** | Dedicated portfolio normalization and valuation behavior exists for the connector. |
| **Contract-tested** | Recorded connector-shaped fixtures pass the common account/position contract, but this is not a promise that every broker account variant has been live-tested. |
| **Experimental** | The profile is structurally read-only and can be selected, but its currencies, account totals, or instrument semantics still need broker-specific verification. |

Every position row must provide a symbol and quantity. Unsupported currencies fail the source explicitly instead of being silently treated as USD. The current valuation core supports USD, HKD and CNY; IBKR, Longbridge and Binance use native handling, while Alpaca and OKX have common-contract coverage. OKX account balance details are adapted into spot holdings alongside any open positions. Robinhood reads the one account you pick from the broker's own list (`vibe-trading connector select-account <id>` or the connection center) and never falls back to a default account; its equity positions are listed unpriced until the quote reply is mapped, and an account that also holds options, crypto, futures, event contracts, mutual funds or fixed income fails the source instead of showing an equity-only view. A new built-in connector or local plugin defaults to **Experimental** until its portfolio contract fixtures are added.

### AI-friendly connector onboarding

Built-in SDK connectors publish one machine-readable onboarding contract: authentication type, required credential fields, optional dependency, install command, and the read-only operation used for verification. `trading_connections` exposes the same contract to MCP clients, while the Portfolio connection center renders it as a generic form. The contract contains field names only — never credential values.

For a terminal-first setup, let the CLI collect secrets locally instead of putting them in a prompt or shell arguments:

```bash
vibe-trading connector setup okx-live-sdk-readonly \
  --connection-id main-okx \
  --label "Main OKX"
```

The CLI prompts in the local terminal, stores values under that connection id in the OS keyring, and runs the connector's read-only check. The equivalent Web flow is **Portfolio → Manage accounts → Open connection center → choose a template → save to keyring → test connection**. MCP read tools may use `connection_id`; the process resolves its credentials from the vault, so keys never travel through MCP. Existing `~/.vibe-trading/<connector>.json` and environment configurations remain a compatibility fallback until a connection has a complete vault credential set.

Do not paste broker API keys into an AI chat. Let the AI choose the connector, install the declared dependency, and interpret diagnostics; enter secrets only in the local hidden terminal prompt or local connection form.

Read-only connectors you install yourself stay outside the checkout, in `~/.vibe-trading/connectors/<name>/`: a `connector.json` manifest plus an `adapter.py` implementing `check_status` / `get_account_snapshot` / `get_positions`. A manifest declaring any write capability is rejected.

```bash
vibe-trading connector init my-broker --destination /tmp
vibe-trading connector validate /tmp/my-broker
vibe-trading connector install /tmp/my-broker
```

Their credentials go to the OS keyring (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service) with `pip install "vibe-trading-ai[keyring]"`, never into the config files. Nothing on this path can place or cancel an order.

---

## 🧪 Research Workflow

Most runs follow the same evidence path: route the request, load the right market context, execute tools, validate outputs, and keep the artifacts inspectable.

The agent stops with a visible recovery request after eight consecutive tool-call
iterations without a new successful observation. Repeating the same read result
or a failed call does not reset this budget. An identical call is refused from
its SECOND failure onward — one retry after a transient failure (a rate limit, a
network blip, a tool timeout) still runs — until a successful state-changing tool
executes or a new run starts; changed arguments can always execute. The recovery
asks for an artifact path or permission to rerun the missing research step, and
the run remains failed even if older metrics exist. This guard is separate from
the wall-clock activity watchdog.

| Layer | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Plan** | Selects the relevant finance skills, tools, data sources, and swarm preset when useful. |
| **Ground** | Pulls A-shares, HK/US/Canada/UK equities, crypto, futures, forex, documents, or web context through the available loaders. |
| **Execute** | Generates testable strategy code, runs tools, and uses the matching backtest engine or analysis workflow. |
| **Validate** | Adds metrics, benchmark comparison, Monte Carlo, Bootstrap, Walk-Forward, run cards, and warnings where applicable. |
| **Deliver** | Returns reports, artifacts, tool traces, and exports for TradingView, TDX, MetaTrader 5, MCP clients, or later sessions. |

## 📡 Data Sources & Smart Fallback

One `get_market_data` call, **28 market-data sources**, one of them the optional **QVeris** premium marketplace. Set `source: "auto"` — the loader picks by symbol, then walks a per-market chain ordered by **IP-ban risk**: never-banned public sources first, throttled / key-gated ones last. Zero config, no single point of failure.

| Source | Markets | Auth | Role |
|--------|---------|------|------|
| `tencent` · `mootdx` | A-share + HK | none | never IP-banned (`mootdx` = 通达信 TCP) |
| `eastmoney` | A / US / HK | none | OHLCV + deep fundamentals & flow tools (throttled) |
| `baostock` · `akshare` | A (+ US/HK/futures/macro/fx) | none | free fallbacks |
| `tushare` | A / HK / futures / fund / macro | token | richest A-share |
| `gildata` | A-share | token (Settings / `GILDATA_TOKEN`) | Hundsun Juyuan (恒生聚源) commercial feed — forward-adjusted dailies, joins the A-share chain tail |
| `yahoo` | US / HK / Canada / UK | none | direct chart/quotes/options; TSX `.TO` / TSXV `.V`; LSE `.L` with declared-currency normalization |
| `sina` · `stooq` | US | none | K-line to 1984 · EOD CSV |
| `yfinance` | US / HK / Canada / UK | none | wrapper; TSX `.TO` / TSXV `.V`; LSE `.L` under the same GBP/GBp contract |
| `longbridge` | US / HK | App Key + App Secret + Access Token | optional historical OHLCV source; install the optional SDK |
| `finnhub` · `alphavantage` · `tiingo` · `fmp` | US | key | optional providers |
| `qveris` | global multi-asset | key · credits | **premium marketplace** — 63+ providers via one key (explicit-only, never in auto fallback) |
| `nobitex` · `wallex` | crypto (Iranian Toman pairs) | none | public UDF endpoints; **explicit-only** — the only Toman-quoted sources, so they never join the crypto chain where a USD-quoted series could stand in for one |
| `okx` · `ccxt` · `binance` | crypto | none | OKX + 100+ exchanges + Binance historical / USD-M perps |
| `futu` | HK / A | OpenD | optional local FutuOpenD |
| `mt5` | forex / metals | MT5 terminal | MetaTrader 5 (Exness-style) forex / metal bars, 1m–1D |
| `tickerall` | forex / metals | key + account (read-only) | same broker MT5 feed, **hosted** — no local terminal, any OS (explicit-only, never in auto fallback) |
| `pykrx` | Korea (KRX: KOSPI/KOSDAQ) | none | daily KOSPI / KOSDAQ bars for `.KS` / `.KQ` (optional `krx` extra) |
| `india_broker` | India (NSE/BSE) | broker login | read-only Zerodha / Shoonya / Dhan bars for `.NS` / `.BO` (fallback-chain tail) |
| `local` | any | none | your own CSV / Parquet / DuckDB via `local:` prefix |

**Fallback chains (by IP-ban risk):**

- **A-share** → `tencent` · `mootdx` · `eastmoney` · `baostock` · `akshare` · `tushare` · `gildata` · `local`
- **US** → `yahoo` · `stooq` · `sina` · `eastmoney` · `yfinance` · `tiingo` · `fmp` · `finnhub` · `alphavantage` · `longbridge` · `akshare` · `local`
- **HK** → `tencent` · `eastmoney` · `yahoo` · `futu` · `akshare` · `yfinance` · `tushare` · `longbridge` · `local`
- **India (NSE/BSE)** → `yahoo` · `yfinance` · `india_broker` · `local`
- **Korea (KOSPI/KOSDAQ)** → `pykrx` · `yahoo` · `yfinance` · `local`
- **UK (LSE)** → `yahoo` · `yfinance` · `local` *(declared GBP/GBp quotes only)*
- **Crypto** → `okx` · `ccxt` · `binance` · `yfinance` · `local`
- **Forex / metals** → `mt5` · `yfinance` · `akshare` · `local` &nbsp;·&nbsp; *(futures / fund / macro → `tushare`/`akshare` → `local`)*

### Using Longbridge explicitly

Longbridge is an optional US/HK historical OHLCV loader. Install its SDK with:

```bash
pip install "vibe-trading-ai[longbridge]"
```

Configure the three credentials in `.env`:

```dotenv
LONGBRIDGE_APP_KEY=...
LONGBRIDGE_APP_SECRET=...
LONGBRIDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

For a backtest, set `source` in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "codes": ["QQQ.US"],
  "start_date": "2025-01-01",
  "end_date": "2025-01-10",
  "interval": "1D",
  "source": "longbridge"
}
```

In an Agent conversation, ask explicitly: **"Use Longbridge to fetch QQQ.US historical data."** The explicit source request is separate from `source: "auto"`; `auto` keeps the normal per-market fallback chain.

Beyond OHLCV, **22 read-only data tools** reach into fundamentals & flow — fund flow, dragon-tiger, northbound, margin, block trades, shareholder count, lockup, sector, research reports, news, SEC filings, financial statements, options chains, stock profile, market screening, symbol search, macro, iwencai, institutional holdings (13F), ETF look-through, prediction markets, and research papers — all exposed over MCP. An explicit `local:` symbol never silently falls back to a network source.

<summary><b>Custom Data Source</b> <sub>register your own historical OHLCV loader</sub></summary>

Need a market or vendor we don't ship a loader for? Add your own historical-bar
loader and select it with `source="<name>"`. The steps edit package source, so
run from a clone (`pip install -e .`).

1. **Write the loader** — create `agent/backtest/loaders/<name>_loader.py` with a
   class that satisfies `DataLoaderProtocol` (duck-typed, no base class needed)
   and is tagged with `@register`:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from backtest.loaders.registry import register

   @register
   class DataLoader:
       name = "mysource"            # the value you pass as source=
       markets = {"us_equity"}      # a_share/us_equity/hk_equity/crypto/futures/fund/macro/forex
       requires_auth = False

       def is_available(self) -> bool:
           return True              # token present? network reachable?

       def fetch(self, codes, start_date, end_date, *, interval="1D", fields=None):
           # return {symbol: DataFrame indexed by trade_date,
           #         columns: open, high, low, close, volume}
           ...
   ```

2. **Register the module** so `@register` fires — add
   `"backtest.loaders.<name>_loader"` to `_loader_modules` in
   `agent/backtest/loaders/registry.py`.
3. **Allow the name** through config validation — add `"mysource"` to
   `_VALID_SOURCES` in `agent/backtest/runner.py`.
4. *(Optional)* slot it into a market's `FALLBACK_CHAINS` in `registry.py` so
   `source="auto"` can reach it.
5. **Use it** — `source="mysource"` in a backtest config, or via the CLI / agent.

> **Real-time ticks / order-book depth are out of scope for loaders** — the
> loader layer is point-in-time historical bars only. Live market data flows
> through the broker connectors instead: `okx` / `binance` / `ccxt` for crypto,
> `futu` / `tiger` for equities.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Broker Connectors</b> <sub>18 brokers — read + paper, bounded-live where supported</sub></summary>

Connector-first profiles. Most do read + paper-account order placement — IBKR is read-only, Robinhood is live-only (no paper account), Scalable Capital is read-only (no paper account exists at all), and Trading 212 and Toss Securities refuse order placement entirely, paper included; live order placement is bounded by a user-defined mandate (symbol allowlist, order-size / exposure caps, daily trade cap, instant kill switch) and never holds funds — the broker executes. Order-placing tools stay off MCP (agent + CLI only). Research / backtest paths are structurally barred from any live endpoint.

| Broker | Markets | Capabilities |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **IBKR** | global | local TWS / Gateway, read-only |
| **Robinhood** | US | Agentic MCP (desktop OAuth) — read + bounded live |
| **Scalable Capital** | DE / EU | Agentic MCP (desktop OAuth) — fully read-only; no paper account exists |
| **Tiger** | US / HK / A | read + paper + bounded live |
| **Alpaca** | US | read + paper + bounded live (+ TAP credential-isolation mode) |
| **OKX** · **Binance** | crypto | read + paper + bounded live |
| **Futu** | HK / US / A | read + paper + bounded live |
| **eToro** | global | read + paper + bounded live (Public API; demo keys reach only `/demo` paths, plus copy-trading workflows) |
| **MetaTrader 5** | forex / CFD | read + paper + bounded live (Exness-style; demo ⇔ paper identity guard) |
| **KIS** (한국투자증권) | Korea (KOSPI/KOSDAQ) | read + genuine paper (모의투자, a real broker-side sandbox on a separate host) — live order placement not yet wired for this market |
| **Longbridge** · **Dhan** · **Shoonya** · **Zerodha** · **Upbit** | US / HK · India (NSE/BSE) · Korea (crypto) | read + paper only — no runtime paper/live discriminator, so live order placement is hard-refused |
| **Trading 212** · **Toss Securities** | UK / EU · Korea/US | fully read-only — `place_order` / `cancel_order` hard-refuse even paper (no verified sandbox) |

Paper-vs-live is a **structural per-broker runtime guard** (account-id format, host separation, demo flag, or trade environment), never a config flag the agent can flip. A broker exposing no such discriminator is capped at paper + read-only.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Quant Library</b> <sub>348 tested functions across 25 modules, callable from every transport</sub></summary>

`src/quantlib` holds one tested implementation of each piece of finance math the
agent needs. Skills **import** these rather than carrying formulas inside
markdown code blocks — if you find a pricing formula living in a `SKILL.md`,
that is a bug, not a pattern.

| Module | What it covers |
|--------|----------------|
| `options` | Black-Scholes price + greeks, implied-volatility inversion |
| `fixedincome` | Bond math, Nelson-Siegel / Svensson curve fitting |
| `credit` | Altman Z-score, Merton / KMV distance-to-default |
| `timeseries` | Stationarity, cointegration, GARCH, bootstrap |
| `risk` · `var_backtest` | VaR / CVaR / EVT and their backtests |
| `attribution` | Brinson-Fachler decomposition |
| `performance` · `fundmath` | TWR / MWR / Modified Dietz; XIRR / MOIC / DPI / TVPI |
| `factormodel` · `eventstudy` | Factor regressions, event studies |
| `multipletesting` · `crossvalidation` | Deflated significance, purged CV |
| `impact` | Market-impact models |
| `volatility` | Heston (1993) stochastic-volatility pricing |
| `portfolio` | Hierarchical Risk Parity allocation |
| `copula` | Gaussian and Archimedean copulas |
| `microstructure` | VPIN, Roll spread, Amihud illiquidity, Kyle's lambda |

The read-only `quantlib_call` tool reaches all of it through one contract, so the
finance math works on the CLI, the Web UI, the REST API and MCP — including
deployments where `bash` is gated off. It is
structurally not a shell — module allowlist, `__all__`-only dispatch, `export_*`
refused. Econometrics needs the `stats` extra
(`pip install "vibe-trading-ai[stats]"`); those functions lazy-import and tell
you which one is missing.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Valuation & Institutional Research</b> <sub>DCF, comps, three-statement, and six research commands</sub></summary>

A valuation engine that refuses to invent its own inputs. The one rule in
`contracts.py`: **a missing input makes a model NOT RUNNABLE and is never
silently defaulted** — every default in a valuation model is an opinion wearing
a constant's clothes.

| Model | Behaviour worth knowing |
|-------|-------------------------|
| `run_dcf` | FCFF bridge, WACC build, mid-year discounting, net-debt bridge, WACC×g sensitivity grid. Dual terminal value: each method is cross-checked against the other's implied multiple and implied g |
| `run_comps` | EV bridge, LTM + calendar-year calendarisation, multiple matrix. A peer with a non-positive denominator is **excluded and reported**, never averaged in as a negative multiple |
| `threestatement` | Linked projection with a hard balance assertion, an explicit revolver plug, and an iterated interest↔debt circularity that must converge or raise |

Artifacts are input-hashed and versioned, with xlsx / pptx export.

Six slash commands drive the workflows — `/comps` `/dcf` `/attrib` `/memo`
`/earnings` `/screen` — each carrying a step skeleton and an
arithmetic-consistent worked example (the Brinson decomposition sums exactly to
active return; the earnings bridge sums exactly to the EPS delta). The
`investor-lenses` skill stacks named-investor reasoning frameworks on top as
analysis overlays: each lens is an operating procedure — priority signals,
disqualifying conditions, typical misuse — not a biography, and names no tool.

Beyond bars, `src/entities` ingests irregular dated cash flows (NAVs, capital
calls, coupons) and `cashflow_performance` reports XIRR / MOIC / DPI / TVPI /
TWR / Modified Dietz / MWR over them. This path is deliberately parallel to the
bar engines so a `nav` column can never reach one and get priced as a close.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Governance & Audit Trail</b> <sub>answer "what methodology produced that number?"</sub></summary>

Every run writes a **manifest** hashing the prompt, the skill contents, the tool
registry and the package versions, so a number produced last month can be traced
to the exact methodology that produced it.

The **audit ledger** chains each record to its predecessor's hash and fsyncs, so
editing or deleting a record is detectable — and an edit that recomputes its own
hash is still caught one record later via `prev_hash_mismatch`. Timestamps are
always caller-supplied; no module here calls `datetime.now()`.

Trace redaction is **sink-aware**: tool-call arguments and the live audit ledger
use a fail-closed sink where `content` stays redacted, while the tool-result
sink releases it and pattern-scrubs its string leaves. `env` is never released
in either.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-line install (PyPI)

```bash
pip install vibe-trading-ai
```

Then run a first research task:

```bash
vibe-trading init
vibe-trading run -p "Backtest a BTC-USDT 20/50 moving-average strategy for 2024 and summarize return and drawdown"
```

> **Upgrading from an older version?** 0.1.10 moved to LangChain 1.x. If imports break after `pip install -U vibe-trading-ai` over a pre-0.1.10 install (e.g. langgraph fails to import), recreate the venv or run `pip install --force-reinstall vibe-trading-ai`. A fresh install is unaffected.

> **Package name vs commands:** The PyPI package is `vibe-trading-ai`. Once installed, you get three commands:
>
> | Command | Purpose |
> |---------|---------|
> | `vibe-trading` | Interactive CLI / TUI |
> | `vibe-trading serve` | Launch FastAPI web server |
> | `vibe-trading-mcp` | Start MCP server (for Claude Desktop, OpenClaw, Cursor, etc.) |

```bash
vibe-trading init              # interactive .env setup
vibe-trading                   # launch CLI
vibe-trading serve --port 8899 # launch web UI
vibe-trading-mcp               # start MCP server (stdio)
```

### Or choose a path

| Path | Best for | Time |
|------|----------|------|
| **A. Docker** | Try it now, zero local setup | 2 min |
| **B. Local install** | Development, full CLI access | 5 min |
| **C. MCP plugin** | Plug into your existing agent | 3 min |
| **D. ClawHub** | One command, no cloning | 1 min |

### Prerequisites

- An **LLM API key** from any supported provider — or run locally with **Ollama** (no key needed)
- **Python 3.11+** for Path B
- **Docker** for Path A
- OpenAI Codex can also be used with ChatGPT OAuth: set `LANGCHAIN_PROVIDER=openai-codex`, then run `vibe-trading provider login openai-codex`. This does not use `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- GitHub Copilot can be used with an active Copilot subscription instead of a separately billed LLM API key. See [GitHub Copilot SDK provider](#github-copilot-sdk-provider).

> **Supported LLM providers:** OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic (native Messages API), DeepSeek, OpenCode (Go / Zen), Gemini, Groq, DashScope/Qwen, Zhipu, Moonshot/Kimi, MiniMax, SiliconFlow (CN + Global), Xiaomi MIMO, Novita AI, iFlytek Spark, Z.ai, NVIDIA NIM, ModelScope, GitHub Copilot, Ollama (local). When no `*_BASE_URL` is set, each provider falls back to its canonical endpoint, so just a key is enough. See `.env.example` for config.

> **Tip:** All markets work without any API keys thanks to automatic fallback. yfinance/Yahoo (HK/US/Canada/UK), OKX (crypto), mootdx (A-shares, TCP-direct, no IP throttle), and AKShare (A-shares, US, HK, futures, forex) are all free. LSE `.L` quotes must declare GBP or GBp so pence can be normalized before GBP accounting. Tushare token is optional — mootdx is the preferred no-token A-share fallback, with AKShare as a broader backup.

### GitHub Copilot SDK provider

The official GitHub Copilot SDK ships as an optional extra, so install it alongside Vibe-Trading with `pip install "vibe-trading-ai[copilot]"`; installing the Copilot CLI is optional. Authenticate with any one of these supported methods:

```bash
gh auth login                         # use GitHub CLI credentials
# or run `copilot` and sign in         # stores credentials in the OS keychain
# or export COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=gho_xxx
```

Then configure `agent/.env`:

```dotenv
LANGCHAIN_PROVIDER=copilot
LANGCHAIN_MODEL_NAME=claude-sonnet-5
# COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=gho_xxx         # optional; recommended for Docker/CI
```

Start Vibe-Trading normally. Its preflight reports whether the SDK can authenticate:

```bash
vibe-trading
```

Authentication priority is `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, stored Copilot CLI credentials, then `gh` credentials. Vibe-Trading does not copy or persist SDK credentials. Host keychain credentials are not automatically available inside Docker, so containers should receive `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Path A: Docker (zero setup)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading.git
cd Vibe-Trading
cp agent/.env.example agent/.env
# Edit agent/.env — uncomment your LLM provider and set API key
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:8899`. Backend + frontend in one container.

> [!NOTE]
> **OpenAI Codex OAuth with Docker:** the browser login needs a terminal so you
> can paste the callback URL. Run it through Compose, which allocates an
> interactive terminal automatically:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose exec vibe-trading vibe-trading provider login openai-codex
> ```
>
> If you use `docker exec` directly, pass `-it` before the container name.

Docker publishes the backend on `127.0.0.1:8899` by default and runs the app as a non-root container user. If you intentionally expose the API beyond your own machine, set a strong `API_AUTH_KEY` and send `Authorization: Bearer <key>` from clients.

> [!NOTE]
> **Using Ollama with Docker:** the container reaches a host-side Ollama via `host.docker.internal`, not `localhost` (inside the container `localhost` is the container itself). `docker-compose.yml` defaults `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`; export `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` (or set it in a top-level `.env`) to point elsewhere. This relies on the `host-gateway` mapping in `extra_hosts`, which requires **Docker Engine ≥ 20.10 / Compose v2** (provided automatically on Docker Desktop).

Your data survives updates: persistent memory, the cross-session search index, user-created skills, shadow accounts, broker connector config, web sessions, backtest runs, swarm history, and uploads all live in named Docker volumes, so `git pull && docker compose up --build` keeps them. In-progress Web replies are checkpointed too, so a restart restores the partial response and marks the attempt interrupted instead of silently dropping it. Data is deleted only by `docker compose down -v`.

### Path B: Local install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading.git
cd Vibe-Trading
python -m venv .venv

# Activate
source .venv/bin/activate          # Linux / macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate.bat       # Windows CMD
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1       # Windows PowerShell

pip install -e .
cp agent/.env.example agent/.env   # Edit — set your LLM provider API key
vibe-trading                       # Launch interactive TUI
```

> [!NOTE]
> **On Windows:** `cp` is a PowerShell alias for `Copy-Item`, so the snippets above work as-is in PowerShell. CMD has no `cp` — use `copy agent\.env.example agent\.env` instead (this applies to the Docker snippet above too). If PowerShell refuses to run `Activate.ps1`, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` first; it applies to that shell session only.

<details>
<summary><b>Start web UI (optional)</b></summary>

```bash
# Terminal 1: API server
vibe-trading serve --port 8899

# Terminal 2: Frontend dev server
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev  # requires Node >= 22.22
```

Open `http://localhost:5899`. The frontend proxies API calls to `localhost:8899`.

**Production mode (single server):**

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..
vibe-trading serve --port 8899     # FastAPI serves dist/ as static files
```

> [!NOTE]
> `vibe-trading serve` binds `0.0.0.0` and is loopback-only by default: opening the UI on the **same machine** (`http://localhost:8899`) works with zero config. If you browse from **another machine, a VM host, or a phone on your LAN**, sensitive endpoints return `403` and the chat shows "Remote API access requires an API key" — set a strong `API_AUTH_KEY` in `agent/.env`, restart, and enter the same key once in **Settings**. (Docker Desktop's host gateway: set `VIBE_TRADING_TRUST_DOCKER_LOOPBACK=1` with the default `127.0.0.1` port bind.)

</details>

### Path C: MCP plugin

See [MCP Plugin](#-mcp-plugin) section below.

### Path D: ClawHub (one command)

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install vibe-trading --force
```

The skill + MCP config is downloaded into your agent's skills directory. See [ClawHub install](#-mcp-plugin) for details.

## 🧠 Environment Variables

Copy `agent/.env.example` to `agent/.env` and uncomment the provider block you want. Each provider needs 3-4 variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|:--------:|-------------|
| `LANGCHAIN_PROVIDER` | Yes | Provider name (`openrouter`, `deepseek`, `groq`, `ollama`, etc.) |
| `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` | Yes* | API key (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, etc.) |

| `LANGCHAIN_REASONING_EFFORT` | No | Reasoning effort (`none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `max`) |
| `LANGCHAIN_USE_RESPONSES_API` | No | Responses transport override: literal `true` uses `/v1/responses` when the endpoint supports it; native adapters retain their own transport; all other values use Chat Completions |
| `TUSHARE_TOKEN` | No | Tushare Pro token for A-share data (falls back to AKShare) |
| `TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | No | LLM call timeout, default 120s |
| `API_AUTH_KEY` | Recommended for network deployments | Bearer token required when the API is reachable from non-local clients |
| `VIBE_TRADING_ENABLE_SHELL_TOOLS` | No | Explicit opt-in for shell-capable tools in remote API/MCP-SSE style deployments |

### 🎯 Recommended Models

Vibe-Trading is a tool-heavy agent — skills, backtests, memory, and swarms all flow through tool calls. Model choice directly decides whether the agent *uses* its tools or fabricates answers from training data.

| Tier | Examples | When to use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Best** | `anthropic/claude-opus-4.7`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`, `openai/gpt-5.5-pro`, `google/gemini-3.5-flash` | Complex swarms (3+ agents), long research sessions, paper-grade analysis |
| **Sweet spot** (default) | `deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`, `x-ai/grok-4.20`, `z-ai/glm-5.1`, `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6`, `qwen/qwen3-max-thinking` | Daily driver — reliable tool-calling at ~1/10 the cost |
| **Avoid for agent use** | `*-nano`, `*-flash-lite`, `*-coder-next`, small / distilled variants | Tool-calling is unreliable — the agent will appear to "answer from memory" instead of loading skills or running backtests |

The default `agent/.env.example` uses OpenRouter + `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`; for the DeepSeek official API, select `LANGCHAIN_PROVIDER=deepseek` and `deepseek-v4-pro`.

## 🖥 CLI Reference

The interactive TUI (`vibe-trading`) now uses a terminal-native transcript: a startup banner, prompt rule, previous-turn recap, live activity rail, Markdown/table rendering, and run timing all stay in the CLI. Non-interactive invocations such as `vibe-trading run`, pipes, and `--json` remain script-friendly.

<details>
<summary><b>IM channels</b></summary>

IM channel adapters connect outside chat apps to the same session runtime used by the Web UI and CLI. Configure enabled adapters under `channels` in `~/.vibe-trading/agent.json`; SDK-backed adapters are optional extras, and missing SDKs report recovery hints instead of crashing the runtime.

For long-running channel tasks, tune the central assistant-reply wait budget with `replyTimeoutS` (seconds, default `600`):

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "replyTimeoutS": 1800,
    "feishu": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

This controls how long the shared channel runtime waits for the agent session to produce an assistant message; adapter HTTP/socket timeouts remain adapter-specific.

```bash
vibe-trading channels status --local   # inspect config and missing SDK hints without API
vibe-trading channels status           # query the running API runtime
vibe-trading channels start            # start enabled adapters through the API
vibe-trading channels stop             # stop enabled adapters through the API
vibe-trading channels login weixin     # run an adapter login hook when needed
vibe-trading channels pairing --channel telegram list
```

Telegram long polling permits only one active `getUpdates` poller per bot
token. `vibe-trading serve` owns the channel runtime; it starts channels at
startup when `VIBE_TRADING_CHANNELS_AUTO_START=true`, and the Web UI controls
that same runtime. `vibe-trading channels start` sends a start request to the
running API server (`VIBE_TRADING_API_URL`, default
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`), so running it against that same server after
auto-start does not create another poller. Keep only one API server process
with a given Telegram bot token enabled. Separate server processes, or a CLI
configured to target a different server, each own a runtime and can conflict
when they use the same token.

`vibe-trading channels login feishu` saves the QR-authorized app credentials to
`~/.vibe-trading/agent.json` with owner-only file permissions before reporting
login success.

The built-in adapters cover `websocket`, `telegram`, `slack`, `discord`, `matrix`, `whatsapp`, `signal`, `qq`, `napcat`, `weixin`, `wecom`, `feishu`, `dingtalk`, `msteams`, `email`, and `mochat`. Use narrow extras such as `pip install "vibe-trading-ai[telegram]"`, or install the full channel set with `pip install "vibe-trading-ai[channels]"`.

**In-chat slash commands** (channel-agnostic, work in all 16 adapters):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | Reset the current session — the next message starts a fresh conversation |
| `/reset` | Alias for `/new` |
| `/newsession` | Alias for `/new` |
| `/pairing list` | Show pending sender-pairing requests (operators only) |

Commands are case-insensitive and must be sent as the entire message (e.g. `hello /new` is treated as a regular message, not a reset).

> **`/pairing` is operator-gated.** In-chat pairing-control commands are rejected unless the sender is listed as an operator — set `channels.operators` (cross-channel authority) or a channel section's own `operators` list in your channels config. With no operators configured, in-chat `/pairing` is refused (fail-closed) and pairing is managed only through the authenticated CLI (`vibe-trading channels pairing …`) and the auth-gated REST endpoint. This prevents any allow-listed group member from taking over pairing across channels.

**Configure from the Web UI**: the **IM Channels** panel on the Settings page configures channels without hand-editing files. Expand a channel to open its config panel: fields render from backend metadata, and secret values are never returned to the browser, only masked (`****` plus the last 4 characters). DingTalk is the first fully-guided channel: create an app at [open-dev.dingtalk.com](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/), add the bot capability, enable Stream Mode (no public callback URL needed), copy the AppKey into Client ID and the AppSecret into Client Secret, then publish the app. QQ has joined it as a fully-guided channel: register a bot on the QQ Open Platform ([q.qq.com](https://q.qq.com/)), copy the AppID and AppSecret into the form, verify with **Test connection** before saving, then enable; no public callback URL is needed (WebSocket via the official botpy SDK). Email and WebSocket have joined as fully-guided channels: Email's **Test connection** probes the IMAP login, the mailbox folder and the SMTP login against your provider without sending anything, while WebSocket — a local server rather than a remote service — validates the TLS certificate/key material and the address availability on this machine; an address held by the already-running server reads as the expected state, not a failure. Saving a WebSocket config hot-swaps the server, so connected clients (including the Web UI chat) briefly disconnect and reconnect. **Test connection** probes the values in the form before anything is saved and answers with an honest result code (`ok`, `invalid_credentials`, `network`, or `unsupported`). **Enable** applies immediately: a running channel runtime hot-swaps that one adapter with no process restart, and enabling auto-verifies credentials unless you explicitly choose **Enable anyway** after a failed check. Disabling a channel keeps its stored credentials, so re-enabling needs no re-entry. Only the built-in adapters are listed here; entry-points plugin channels remain file-configured.

Saves write the `channels.<name>` section of `~/.vibe-trading/agent.json` atomically. YAML config files are read-only for the web UI (JSON is required to edit from the browser), and the panel says so instead of failing. Channels without a dedicated guide render a generic form derived from their defaults.

## 💡 Examples

### Strategy & Backtesting

```bash
# Moving average crossover on US equities
vibe-trading run -p "Backtest a 20/50-day moving average crossover on AAPL for the past year, show Sharpe ratio and max drawdown"

# RSI mean-reversion on crypto
vibe-trading run -p "Test RSI(14) mean-reversion on BTC-USDT: buy below 30, sell above 70, last 6 months"

# Multi-factor strategy on A-shares
vibe-trading run -p "Backtest a momentum + value + quality multi-factor strategy on CSI 300 constituents over 2 years"

# After backtesting, export to TradingView / TDX / MetaTrader 5
vibe-trading --pine <run_id>
```

For calendar-triggered partial rebalancing, keep the strategy signal dense and
select execution bars in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "position_adjustment": "rebalance",
  "rebalance_mask": "MS"
}
```

`MS` executes the aligned target on the first observed trading bar of each
month. Weekly/quarterly pandas offset aliases (for example `W-FRI` and `QS`) and
explicit ISO date lists are also accepted. An alias must not be finer than the
aligned bar interval. Period aliases select the first observed bar in each
period; `W-FRI` starts a Friday-anchored week and therefore normally executes
on the following Monday, not on Friday itself. Omit `rebalance_mask` to
preserve the existing every-bar rebalance behavior. A mask is deliberately
incompatible with `position_adjustment="hold"`.

**Bench a pre-built alpha zoo** (one line):
```bash
vibe-trading alpha bench --zoo gtja191 --universe csi300 --period 2018-2025 --top 20
```

**Browse the catalogue** and inspect a single alpha:
```bash
vibe-trading alpha list --zoo gtja191 --theme reversal --limit 10
vibe-trading alpha show gtja191_171
```

**Compose a multi-factor signal** from the zoo (Python):
```python
from src.skills.multi_factor.zoo_signal_engine import ZooSignalEngine
engine = ZooSignalEngine.from_zoo(["gtja191_171", "gtja191_111", "gtja191_163"])
panel = ...  # your wide OHLCV panel
signal = engine.compute_signal(panel)
```

### Market Research

```bash
# Equity deep-dive
vibe-trading run -p "Research NVDA: earnings trend, analyst consensus, option flow, and key risks for next quarter"

# Macro analysis
vibe-trading run -p "Analyze the current Fed rate path, USD strength, and impact on EM equities and gold"

# Crypto on-chain
vibe-trading run -p "Deep dive BTC on-chain: whale flows, exchange balances, miner activity, and funding rates"
```

### Swarm Workflows

```bash
# Bull/bear debate on a stock
vibe-trading --swarm-run investment_committee '{"topic": "Is TSLA a buy at current levels?"}'

# Quant strategy from screening to backtest
vibe-trading --swarm-run quant_strategy_desk '{"universe": "S&P 500", "horizon": "3 months"}'

# Crypto desk: funding + liquidation + flow → risk manager
vibe-trading --swarm-run crypto_trading_desk '{"asset": "ETH-USDT", "timeframe": "1w"}'

# Global macro portfolio allocation
vibe-trading --swarm-run macro_rates_fx_desk '{"focus": "Fed pivot impact on EM bonds"}'

# Resume a failed or cancelled run while keeping its completed tasks
vibe-trading --swarm-retry <run_id> --swarm-resume
```

### Cross-Session Memory

```bash
# Save your preferences once
vibe-trading run -p "Remember: I prefer RSI-based strategies, max 10% drawdown, hold period 5–20 days"

# The agent recalls them in future sessions automatically
vibe-trading run -p "Build a crypto strategy that fits my risk profile"
```

### Upload & Analyze Documents

```bash
# Analyze a broker export or earnings report
vibe-trading --upload trades_export.csv
vibe-trading run -p "Profile my trading behavior and identify any biases"

vibe-trading --upload NVDA_Q1_earnings.pdf
vibe-trading run -p "Summarize the key risks and beats/misses from this earnings report"
```

Interactive docs are available at `http://localhost:8899/docs` in keyless
loopback development mode. When `API_AUTH_KEY` is configured, `/docs` and
`/redoc` are disabled; authenticated tooling can fetch `/openapi.json` with an
`Authorization: Bearer <key>` header.

### Security defaults

For localhost development, `vibe-trading serve` keeps the browser workflow simple. For any non-local client, sensitive API endpoints require `API_AUTH_KEY`; use `Authorization: Bearer <key>` for JSON/upload requests. Browser EventSource streams are handled by the Web UI after you enter the same key once in Settings.

Shell-capable process tools (`bash` / `background_run` / `cancel_background`) are enabled only for the interactive local CLI. Every other surface — the HTTP/SSE API and the MCP server on **all** transports (stdio included) — keeps them off unless you explicitly opt in with `VIBE_TRADING_ENABLE_SHELL_TOOLS=1` (or pass `--enable-shell-tools` to `vibe-trading-mcp`). Transport type never implicitly grants shell access. `cancel_background` stops only the tracked task ID returned by `background_run`; broad Python process-name termination is refused because it could terminate Vibe-Trading itself. Document and journal readers are limited to upload/import roots by default; place files under `~/.vibe-trading/uploads`, `~/.vibe-trading/runs`, `./uploads`, `./data` (or the legacy `agent/uploads` / `agent/runs`), or add a dedicated directory through `VIBE_TRADING_ALLOWED_FILE_ROOTS`. Sessions, runs, swarm runs, uploads, and the `sessions.db` index live under `~/.vibe-trading` (relocatable via the `VIBE_TRADING_HOME` shell environment variable); pre-existing history is moved there automatically on first run.

Generated backtest code runs as a local Python subprocess and can make network requests through the configured market-data loaders. Its environment is intentionally narrow: the runner keeps OS/Python basics, proxy/certificate settings, `VIBE_TRADING_ALLOWED_RUN_ROOTS`, and read-only market-data keys such as `TUSHARE_TOKEN`, `FMP_API_KEY`, `FRED_API_KEY`, and `VIBE_TRADING_IWENCAI_KEY`. It does not pass LLM provider keys, API auth tokens, shell-tool switches, broker trading secrets, or live/advisory toggles to generated strategy code by default.

### Web UI Settings

The Web UI Settings page lets local users update the LLM provider/model, base URL, generation parameters, reasoning effort, and optional market data credentials such as the Tushare token. Settings are persisted to `agent/.env`; provider defaults are loaded from `agent/src/providers/llm_providers.json`.

Settings reads are side-effect free: `GET /settings/llm` and `GET /settings/data-sources` never create `agent/.env`, and they only return project-relative paths. Settings reads and writes can expose credential state or update credentials/runtime environment, so they require `API_AUTH_KEY` when configured. If `API_AUTH_KEY` is unset for dev mode, settings access is accepted only from loopback clients.

The same Settings page includes an **IM Channels** panel for local operators. It polls `/channels/status`, shows configured/enabled/available/loaded/running states, surfaces adapter recovery hints, and can start or stop the configured channel runtime without going back to the terminal.

### Scheduled research

Run a research prompt or backtest on a repeating schedule — from the **Scheduled** page in the web UI or over REST. The background executor is **off by default** — start the server with `VIBE_TRADING_ENABLE_SCHEDULER=1` to enable it:

```bash
VIBE_TRADING_ENABLE_SCHEDULER=1 vibe-trading serve --port 8899
```

Then create jobs over REST. `schedule` is either a bare integer (interval in **milliseconds**) or a 5-field cron expression (`min hour dom mon dow`; each field takes `*`, `*/n`, numbers, comma lists, or low-high ranges like `1-5`). Cron runs on the wall clock of the job's optional `timezone` (an IANA key), so the cadence holds across DST transitions — a spring-forward gap time is skipped, and a fall-back ambiguous time runs once, at its first occurrence. Jobs without a `timezone` keep plain UTC semantics:

```bash
# every 6 hours (cron)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8899/scheduled-runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"Scan CSI300 for momentum breakouts and backtest the top 5","schedule":"0 */6 * * *"}'

# weekdays at 23:30 Auckland wall time — DST-proof
curl -X POST http://localhost:8899/scheduled-runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"Pre-open scan of NZX names","schedule":"30 23 * * 1-5","timezone":"Pacific/Auckland"}'

# list / cancel
curl http://localhost:8899/scheduled-runs
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8899/scheduled-runs/<job_id>
```

Each fire runs the `prompt` through a fresh agent session (optional backtest parameters go in `config`), and jobs persist under `~/.vibe-trading/` so they survive restarts. Without the flag, the `/scheduled-runs` endpoints still record jobs but nothing fires. Add `-H "Authorization: Bearer <key>"` to each call when `API_AUTH_KEY` is set.

The agent sees exactly one scheduling tool, `scheduled_research`. Its read
actions inspect status/jobs/playbooks; `propose_create` and `propose_cancel`
only persist a short-lived confirmation proposal. They never mutate the job
store. Web renders a deterministic confirmation card, CLI asks `y/N`, and IM
conversations require an exact `confirm` (`确认`) or `cancel` (`取消`); only
that surface action calls the commit endpoint. Create drafts carry `title`, `source`, `schedule`,
`end_at`, and `delivery`. Once `end_at` passes, the retained job becomes
`expired` and is not dispatched again.

Scheduled delivery is channel-agnostic. Configure reusable opaque target refs
under `channels.deliveryTargets`; the agent tool and its confirmation surfaces
expose the ref, label, and channel but never the provider's raw chat/user id.
The existing direct REST/admin fields remain available for backward
compatibility:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "deliveryTargets": {
      "research-team": {
        "label": "Research Team",
        "channel": "feishu",
        "target": "<provider chat or user id>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Any configured channel adapter can be selected. Delivery status is `accepted`
when an adapter succeeded without a provider receipt, and `sent` only when the
adapter returned a provider message id (currently implemented end to end for
Feishu). Failures remain retryable in the persisted outbox.

**Five ready-to-schedule templates** ship with the scheduler — `premarket-brief`, `earnings-season-tracker`, `portfolio-checkup`, `a-share-money-flow`, `institutional-holdings-diff`. Each states the data a run needs in plain language instead of naming tools, so a template keeps working as the tool surface grows, and each is required to name a missing input rather than fill it from memory. Reach them from the CLI, over REST, or with `/playbook` in the TUI:

```bash
vibe-trading playbook list                     # the five templates
vibe-trading playbook show premarket-brief     # body, declared variables, suggested cadence
vibe-trading playbook create premarket-brief \
  --var home_market="US equities" --var watchlist="AAPL, MSFT, NVDA" \
  --timezone America/New_York

curl http://localhost:8899/scheduled-runs/playbooks
curl http://localhost:8899/scheduled-runs/playbooks/premarket-brief
curl -X POST http://localhost:8899/scheduled-runs/playbooks/premarket-brief \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"variables":{"home_market":"US equities","watchlist":"AAPL, MSFT, NVDA"}}'
```

Posting `{}` schedules a template on its own suggested cadence with its declared defaults. The rendered body becomes the job prompt verbatim, and an undeclared variable is rejected rather than silently ignored.

## 🔌 MCP Plugin

Vibe-Trading exposes 74 MCP tools for any MCP-compatible client. Runs as a stdio subprocess — no server setup needed. Core research tools work with zero API keys for HK/US/crypto; trading connector tools use the selected connector profile, and `run_swarm` needs an LLM key.

**Environment variables:** the client spawns the server itself, so a shell `export` never reaches it — set them in the client's `env` block. Generated backtest code is sandboxed to the allowed run roots, so writing results into a workspace of your own needs `VIBE_TRADING_ALLOWED_RUN_ROOTS`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe-trading": {
      "command": "vibe-trading-mcp",
      "env": { "VIBE_TRADING_ALLOWED_RUN_ROOTS": "C:\\Users\\me\\research" }
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop</b></summary>

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe-trading": {
      "command": "vibe-trading-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenClaw</b></summary>

Add to `~/.openclaw/config.yaml`:

```yaml
skills:
  - name: vibe-trading
    command: vibe-trading-mcp
```

For a first research-only smoke test, confirm tool discovery and run a market
data or backtest request before selecting a trading connector profile. Core
research tools can run without broker credentials; connector-backed `trading_*`
tools should be used only after you intentionally select and check a connector
profile. `run_swarm` requires an LLM key.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor / Windsurf / other MCP clients</b></summary>

```bash
vibe-trading-mcp                   # stdio (default)
vibe-trading-mcp --transport http  # Streamable HTTP (current MCP spec default) at http://127.0.0.1:8900/mcp
vibe-trading-mcp --transport sse   # legacy SSE (deprecated) for older clients
```

For HTTP clients (QwenPaw, and any client that negotiates by POSTing an
`InitializeRequest`), use `--transport http` and point the client at the single
`/mcp` endpoint — e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8900/mcp`. Do **not** point an HTTP
client at `/sse`; that path belongs to the deprecated two-endpoint SSE transport
and will return `405 Method Not Allowed` on `POST`. Override the bind address

### SWARM external MCP tools

`run_swarm` workers can call operator-approved tools from external MCP servers. Configure the server-side allowlist in `VIBE_TRADING_SWARM_AGENT_CONFIG`, `~/.vibe-trading/swarm-agent.json`, or the fallback `~/.vibe-trading/agent.json`; then list remote tools in a swarm preset using the local MCP wrapper name, such as `mcp_internal_kb_search`. Caller-provided `variables` stay template data only and cannot inject MCP URLs, commands, environment variables, or allowlist overrides.

<details>
<summary><b>Install from ClawHub (one command)</b></summary>

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install vibe-trading --force
```

> `--force` is required because the skill references external APIs, which triggers VirusTotal's automated scan. The code is fully open-source and safe to inspect.

This downloads the skill + MCP config into your agent's skills directory. No cloning needed.

### MetaTrader 5 (Exness and other MT5 brokers)

Connects to a **locally running MT5 terminal** through the official `MetaTrader5` package (**Windows only**):

```bash
pip install "vibe-trading-ai[mt5]"
```

Configure `~/.vibe-trading/mt5.json` (create it yourself; `chmod 600` where supported):

```json
{
  "login": 12345678,
  "password": "...",
  "server": "Exness-MT5Trial8",
  "symbol_suffix": "m",
  "max_order_volume": 1.0,
  "max_order_notional_usd": 10000
}
```

Then:

```bash
vibe-trading connector use mt5-paper-sdk
vibe-trading connector check
vibe-trading connector account
vibe-trading connector quote EURUSD
vibe-trading connector history EURUSD
```

| Profile | Account | Orders |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `mt5-paper-sdk` | demo | read-only |
| `mt5-live-sdk-readonly` | real | read-only |
| `mt5-paper-trade` | demo | direct placement (connector per-order size guards apply) |
| `mt5-live-trade` | real | mandate + kill-switch gated |

Safety boundary: **"paper" means the broker's own demo account**, re-verified on every call — the terminal reports `account_info().trade_mode` and the logged-in account number, so pointing a paper profile at a real-money account (or the reverse) is refused outright. MT5 sizes orders in **lots** (1 lot EURUSD = 100,000 EUR); the live mandate gate prices lots through the connector's USD hook, and the connector's own `max_order_volume` / `max_order_notional_usd` guards apply on demo as well as live, failing closed when a notional cannot be priced. On hedging accounts (the Exness default), note that an opposing order **opens a hedge position** — close by ticket instead (pass the position ticket to `trading_cancel_order`) so the fill is pinned to that position and can only reduce exposure. Rollback / halt path: the kill switch blocks new live orders, while cancellation stays available and is written to the audit log. Mandate limits are denominated in USD; a non-USD account currency is margined by the broker in its own currency.

The `mt5` market-data loader — the head of the forex fallback chain — shares this same `mt5.json`. With no such file it attaches read-only to the most recently used terminal that is already logged in.

---

## 🔌 eToro Public API Connector

Connects to [eToro's Public API](https://builders.etoro.com/) for demo and real accounts via API key pair (`x-api-key` + `x-user-key`). Demo and real environments are separated structurally: demo keys only reach `/demo` API paths.

Configure `~/.vibe-trading/etoro.json` (create it yourself; `chmod 600` where supported):

```json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY",
  "user_key": "YOUR_USER_KEY",
  "profile": "paper"
}
```

Alternatively set `ETORO_API_KEY` and `ETORO_USER_KEY` in `~/.vibe-trading/.env`.

Then:

```bash
vibe-trading connector use etoro-paper-sdk
vibe-trading connector check
vibe-trading connector account
vibe-trading connector positions
vibe-trading connector quote BTC
```

| Profile | Account | Orders |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `etoro-paper-sdk` | demo | read-only |
| `etoro-live-sdk-readonly` | real | read-only |
| `etoro-paper-trade` | demo | direct placement on demo paths |
| `etoro-live-trade` | real | mandate + kill-switch gated |

Symbol lookup uses eToro's `internalSymbolFull` search (e.g. `BTC` → instrument id `100000`). Use the `etoro_search_instruments` agent tool to resolve tickers before trading.

Safety boundary: demo and real are path-separated and key-bound (`paper_guard: path_separated_key_bound`). Live risk-increasing actions (open and copy-start/increase) require an authorized mandate, a clear halt state, and a verified USD account for copy-notional enforcement. Validated full and partial position closes, open-order cancellation, and copy close remain available when halted and are audit-logged. Cancelling a pending close or editing position stops is paper-only: the live path fails closed because those operations can increase exposure or transfer extra margin without enough API data to quantify the incremental USD risk. Copy amounts are denominated in the eToro account currency, and every copy start/adjust requires a caller-supplied 1-35 character URL-safe reference id for polling. eToro-specific write tools (`etoro_close_position`, `etoro_copy_*`, etc.) are agent tools only — not exposed via MCP or CLI. Rollback: revert the connector commit(s) or disable profiles; halt blocks new live risk-increasing actions.

## 🔌 Loading Tools from External MCP Servers (MCP Client Mode)

> **This is the opposite direction from the MCP Plugin above.**
> The MCP Plugin lets *other* agents call Vibe-Trading tools.
> This section lets the *built-in* Vibe-Trading agent call tools from *your* external MCP servers.

### Quick start

Create `~/.vibe-trading/agent.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["my-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Run any CLI command — tools from ordinary external servers are automatically injected into the agent's registry after local tools:

```bash
vibe-trading run "use my-server to do X"
```

### Official IBKR MCP read-only probe

Vibe-Trading can connect directly to Interactive Brokers' official remote MCP
endpoint in read-only mode. Add this to `~/.vibe-trading/agent.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ibkr": {
      "type": "streamableHttp",
      "url": "https://api.ibkr.com/v1/api/mcp-public",
      "auth": {
        "type": "oauth",
        "scopes": ["mcp.read"],
        "clientName": "Vibe-Trading",
        "cacheDir": "~/.vibe-trading/live/ibkr/oauth"
      },
      "enabledTools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then start the browser OAuth flow:

```bash
vibe-trading connector authorize ibkr-live-official-mcp-readonly
```

The wildcard is accepted only for IBKR's `mcp.read` probe. Authorizing this
profile confirms access to IBKR's official read scope; generic `trading_account`
and `trading_positions` calls stay disabled until IBKR publishes stable read
tool names that Vibe-Trading can map safely. A config that adds `mcp.write` must
pin an explicit tool allowlist and still passes through the live order guard.

If IBKR issues a pre-registered OAuth client, add `clientId` and `clientSecret`
inside `auth`.

### Trading connectors: fastest path

For users who cannot wait for IBKR OAuth client approval, connect to a local
TWS or IB Gateway session. Credentials stay inside IBKR's desktop app; Vibe-
Trading only connects to `127.0.0.1` and exposes it as a connector profile.

Install the optional SDK:

```bash
pip install "vibe-trading-ai[ibkr]"
```

Open TWS paper trading or IB Gateway paper, enable API socket clients, then run:

```bash
vibe-trading connector list
vibe-trading connector use ibkr-paper-local
vibe-trading connector configure ibkr-paper-local --yes
vibe-trading connector check
vibe-trading connector account
vibe-trading connector positions
vibe-trading connector orders
vibe-trading connector quote AAPL
vibe-trading connector history AAPL --duration "30 D" --bar-size "1 day"
```

Default local ports:

| App | Paper | Live read-only |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| TWS | `7497` | `7496` |
| IB Gateway | `4002` | `4001` |

The agent exposes connector-scoped tools named `trading_connections`,
`trading_select_connection`, `trading_check`, `trading_account`,
`trading_positions`, `trading_orders`, `trading_quote`, and `trading_history`.
Live-broker raw MCP tools are not registered directly as `mcp_<broker>_*`.
No IBKR order-placement tool is registered.

### 🔐 TAP Mode — full credential isolation & human-approved writes

**Opt-in, off by default.** If the `TAP_*` variables below are unset, the
connector behaves exactly as before (direct broker SDK) — nothing changes.

[TAP](https://tap.human.tech) (Tool Authorization Protocol) is a credential
proxy: the agent never holds the raw broker API secret, and consequential writes
are gated on **human approval**. With TAP mode on, **every** Alpaca call — order
placement, cancel, and the reads (account/positions/orders/quote/bars) — is sent
to the TAP proxy's `/forward` endpoint instead of the broker SDK; TAP injects the
real key server-side, then forwards upstream.

- The agent process holds **no Alpaca key at all** — and doesn't even need
  `alpaca-py` — because the whole egress goes through TAP. The secret is
  referenced by name (`<CREDENTIAL:alpaca.key_id>`) and TAP substitutes it.
- **Writes block on human approval.** An order or cancel cannot reach the broker
  without a human approving it; even a prompt-injected "buy now" is held, and
  denying it means it never reaches Alpaca. Orders carry a deterministic
  `client_order_id`, so an approval-race retry is deduplicated rather than
  double-placed.
- **Reads auto-approve.** Account/positions/orders/quote/bars are GETs that TAP
  forwards without a human step — this is credential *isolation* (no key in the
  process), not a gate, so there's ~zero added friction.
- `allowed_hosts` on the TAP credential pins where the key may be sent, so a
  tampered target is rejected (403) before injection.

**Enable it:**

1. In the TAP dashboard, create a **multi-secret** credential named `alpaca`
   holding your Alpaca key pair as fields `key_id` and `secret_key`, assigned to
   your agent, with allowed hosts `paper-api.alpaca.markets` (or the live host
   `api.alpaca.markets`) **and** `data.alpaca.markets` (the market-data host used
   by quote/bars). Use **separate TAP credentials for paper and live** (e.g.
   `alpaca-paper` / `alpaca-live`, selected via `TAP_ALPACA_CREDENTIAL`), each
   with `allowed_hosts` pinned to its own API host — TAP then structurally
   refuses to send the paper key to the live host and vice versa, keeping the
   paper/live separation crisp end to end.
2. Add to `agent/.env`:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|:--------:|-------------|
| `TAP_PROXY_URL` | Yes | TAP proxy base URL (e.g. `https://proxy.tap.human.tech`) |
| `TAP_AGENT_KEY` | Yes | Your TAP agent API key (secret) |
| `TAP_ALPACA_CREDENTIAL` | No | TAP credential name for Alpaca (default `alpaca`) |
| `TAP_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT` | No | Seconds to wait for a human decision (default `300`) |

When a write is placed, approve or deny it in your TAP channel (Telegram /
dashboard). An approved order/cancel is forwarded to Alpaca; a denied or
timed-out one returns an error and is **never sent**.

> **Known limitation — approval race.** If the human approves right at the
> `TAP_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT` boundary, TAP may forward the order while the poll has
> already given up: the gate then reports an error even though the order reached
> the broker, and the `max_trades_per_day` counter under-counts by one. The
> deterministic `client_order_id` keeps a retry from double-placing that order;
> if you rely on a tight trades-per-day cap, check open orders after a TAP
> timeout error before retrying.

**Scope:** covers Alpaca **order placement, cancel, and all five reads** — the
full connector egress, so the process holds no key on any path. HMAC-signed
brokers (Binance/OKX) are follow-ups (client-side signing doesn't fit pure egress
injection). The hooks are additive — they live inside the Alpaca connector and
leave the live mandate gate unchanged.

### Config reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `type` | string | inferred for stdio; required for HTTP | Omit for stdio, or set to `sse` / `streamableHttp` for URL-based servers. |
| `command` | string | required for stdio | Executable to spawn for stdio servers. Invalid for `sse` / `streamableHttp` servers. |
| `args` | array | `[]` | Command-line arguments for stdio servers only. |
| `env` | object | `{}` | Extra environment variables merged into the subprocess env for stdio servers only. |
| `url` | string | required for `sse` / `streamableHttp` | Remote SSE / streamable HTTP endpoint URL. Not used for stdio servers. |
| `headers` | object | `{}` | Extra HTTP headers for `sse` / `streamableHttp` servers only. |
| `toolTimeout` | number | `30` | Per-tool call timeout in seconds |
| `initTimeout` | number | unset (`max(toolTimeout, 30)`) | MCP initialize / OAuth authorization timeout in seconds. Use this for slow browser authorization without widening ordinary tool calls. |
| `enabledTools` | array | `["*"]` | Tool allowlist. Use `["*"]` to expose all tools from the server |

Config file location: `~/.vibe-trading/agent.json` (JSON or YAML).

For URL-based transports, `type` is required. The agent no longer guesses between SSE and streamable HTTP from the URL suffix.

### Per-session overrides (API)

When creating a session via the API you can pass `mcpServers` inside `session.config` to extend or override the global config for that session only:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "mcpServers": {
      "research-server": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["research-mcp"],
        "enabledTools": ["search", "fetch"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Tool naming

Ordinary remote tools are exposed with stable names: `mcp_<server>_<tool>`.
Live-broker MCP servers stay behind the `trading_*` connector surface.

If two server names produce the same ASCII-safe local prefix (e.g. `foo-bar` and `foo_bar` both become `foo_bar`), a deterministic hash suffix is appended at the server-segment level so names remain unique. The operator receives a warning:

```
WARNING: Configured MCP server 'foo-bar' collides with another server after local name
normalization. Using local tool prefix 'mcp_foo_bar_<hash>_<tool>' to keep generated
tool names unique. Rename the server in agent config if you want a different prefix.
```

### v1 limits

| Limit | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Transport | stdio, SSE, and streamable HTTP |
| Execution | serial only — MCP tools never enter the parallel readonly path |
| Surfaces | tools only (resources and prompts excluded in v1) |
| Hot reload | not supported — restart the process to pick up config changes |
| Swarm path | MCP tools are not available inside Swarm worker registries in v1 |

## PIT and market-actor extension

This fork includes an opt-in [PIT and market-actor MCP extension](extensions/pit_actor_sim/README.md). It reads an external canonical point-in-time warehouse and invokes an existing governed actor simulator. It does not change the default data router, broker connectors, or live trading controls.
